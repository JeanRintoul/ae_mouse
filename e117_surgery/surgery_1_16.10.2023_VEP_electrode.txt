Electrode placement coordinates: 
•	VEP Location: AP -3.5, ML 2.25mm. Right of bregma for left side visual stimulation. 
•	MEP Forelimb Location: AP +0.0 mm, ML 2.0mm left of bregma. 

Copy Pat's protocol, to ensure better headbar adhesion. This mouse will be used for estim only - so exact copy of Pat's surgery inclusive of nail polish and skull scratching ok.

I could have waited longer for the cement to thicken. 
When inserting the electrodes, they were a bit bouncy... having to re-enter multiple times. This could cause damage. 
2hr, 3min moved to warming chamber. 

Altogether though, I am messy with cement... and I think I lack rigor in general with mouse surgery. It is quite possible this is the crux of a lot of my problems and I do need to improve. 

at 1pm, 1 hr after warming chamber, mouse is moved to cage. I will watch it for a couple of hours. It is moving very slowly.
