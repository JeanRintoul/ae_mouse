t18 - can i see a VEP with an EEG placed on the head? 
===============================================================  

isoflurane. 
Can I see a VEP, in a dark adapted mouse? 
What is the impedance of the surface eeg electrode?

run ae_demod_vep.py, but just try and do veps.

What is the impedance on the eeg surface electrode? 
1. vpp = 3.3, ima = 1.718, z = 962. It is great. 
	4hz led

2. it seems to ovld when i move above 100 gain, so keep at 100. 
   i think i can see a vep. 

3. I have a noise issue... and a vep. 

4. turn off the heat mat. looks like a vep, but the time post stimulus is short... could i have some e interference? 

I have insane 50hz. Moving the cable away from the edge of the faraday cage appeared to help. The cables themselves seem to have an issue... there is a non-connection of some sort and it was acting like an antenna. 

I think I am picking up something else. 
So , those cables I am using with min bananas and bncs are fucked.
apart from that, i seem to be piocking up electrical noise from the heatmat and the led. 

The eeg electrode was too dry, and acting like an antenna, voltages were high, load was low... 
The heat mat is adding noise. 
The bnc->mini banana cables are bad? 

I put saline on mouse head, and suddenly what I saw changed a lot. 
With the saline, it is now possible that i have shorted the two electrodes? 

6-20: 4hz VEPs 

21-30 heat mat back on. 

about 2hrs. 

Result: Did I get VEPs? No.
