t19 - saline test
===============================================================  


At Fs= 1e6 I seem to be getting repeatable results, but the result never shows in the FFT due to aliasing issue. 

Use the time series data instead. 


- The harmonic distortion appears to come from the function generator. 

- I can measure resistance correctly with the old style measurement but not with d bonos thing. 

- the harmonic distortion has nothign to do with bonos thing, it is coming from the fg. 

- I think i have a current shunting thing happening when it goes back into the probe... 

- so it depends which side is hooked through to gnd, and which side I am doing the current monitoring on. 


- ok, so I need to get bonos thing working, so that I can measure the impedance correctly. It's possible it is doing the right thing, its just that i have weird stuff coming from the function generator. 

- if i put a gnd on the measurement area, i get a much smaller return current. This is not surprising, and suggests that if i wish to measure current, and apply current. DO NOT GND the probe.

When doing current stimulation, do not add the GND reference to the measurement area, otherwise i will get innaccurate impedance and current measurement. 


- as soon as I make the surface area bigger, current goes up, impedance goes down. AE effect is suddenly up without any positioning changes. 

- 71 on the gnd electrode. 

- the gold electrode... wow. 451

- second time, 931 microvolts, z = 431, i = 6ma. 

1. gold foil electrode and gold cup electrode. 
file 1, shows 12v output (i.e. 30.8Vpp), 40ma. z = 378

file 2. gold leaf electrode/ gold cup electrode. 
499.998khz, v out = 6V i.e. after tx it is  
  i = 15ma, z = 256 ohm,

- So one problem is that I cannot reliably see low difference frequencies. When I move the voltage down to 6V I can more clearly see the df. This suggests I have a DAQ range which is off. But no, something else is happening when the voltage gets larger. 

Altogether I currently have an engineering problem. 
Should I try this in a mouse.

- This would be first mep test with bipolar higher voltage source.
