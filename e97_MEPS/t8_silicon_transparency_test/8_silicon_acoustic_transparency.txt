t8 - in saline phantom test whether the silicon I'm using in the mouse, is acoustically transparent.

All my values are lower than last time when I used the cup electrode. 

When I plug in the start GND reference, suddenly my values are bigger. i.e. 25 microvolts. 

When i add cup electrode - values shoot up again to 41. 
cup electrode leads to higher current value for the same voltage... 

change frequency to higher. goes up a tiny bit but not as much as when I change the shape or position of the electrode. 


move cup electrode closer -65 microvolts. measured current is 0.595mA at 1V injection.

However, when compared with and without silicon sheet, I get close to equivalent values. Thus the silicon is approximately acoustically transparent.

This suggests that if I want a large dF(i.e. for stimulation) I need two electrodes placed close together? This way I have a bigger current density at the location of interest. 

For neural recording, I want the endogenous signal so be amplified as much as possible too. i.e. a big dF. However the injection point is different and I cannot change the actual current density - just how it is measured.

When I plug in the cup electrode, the amplitude of the carrier changes significantly. 

I can see a 6Hz dF, but for neural recording should use preamp. 

32 microvolts, 2v amplitude. 

How the current moves through space seems key here.
