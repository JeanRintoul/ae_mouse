t16 - can I get a MEP with the other mouse? What is the maximum current I can inject? 
===============================================================  

Ket/Xyl with antisedan antidote. 

x = 1.6
k1 = 3.3
k2 = 1

No ultrasound required. Keep it there just in case though. 

- Use the other mouse, it has two PtIr electrodes(one in VEP, one at ML2mm, AP0). Try the implanted electrode, then replace it with a copper cup that rest on stim gel on the head. 

- To increase the surface area try doing a MEP experiment(no US) with two copper cup electrodes. One on top of the head, one in the mouth. 2Hz. 

Questions: 
- Can I do intracranial MEP stimulation, in which case I have more freedom to increase the surface area of electrodes, and it sounds more impressive also to do it non-invasively. 
The paper that did this, claimed the stimulation mA were all the same - which I find weird... and extremely high at 25mA. 
It doesn't appear to give impedance of voltage values. 


- - -  

TODO: 
- Why can't I see low mixing frequencies currently though AE effect? Perhaps the pressure focus and electrodes were not aligned? TO CHECK. 

- - -

Note: I am not getting very accurate impedance measures at low frequencies. This is why injecting at higher frequency is better. 

Try direct electrical stimulation, using the two existing electrodes in the brain.
 
1. two electrodes, 8khz, 1v, z = 837 Ohms. 0.764 ma. 
   12V to get paw movement at 2Hz. Electrode is in the correct position. 9kohm, 0.8mA
  deep anaesthesia
2. one head electrode one cup electrode. 
   1v, 8khz, z = 686ohm, i = 0.88ma. 

   at 2hz, 8v. I can see mouth movement. again, at the low frequencies my impedance and current magnitude seem to be wrong. I think this is because the FFT doesn't work out so well with low repeats. 

3. 8v, 2hz i can clearly see the movement. analyze this for why impedance reads 5.6kohm, i = 0.856

4. impedance test with silver wires attached. 0.658ma, 1kohm. 

5. it says df = 286 microvolts, i = 3.6, z = 1.5 

6. direct 2hz. 12v. nothing, not connected. my connection system is such shit. 

I decided not to place a copper cup, as the cup is so big it obscures vision of the headbar. What I can do is an AE test. 

7. it 

I am having trouble finding the AE focus. i have some sort of shit connection. 

TODO: switch to Pat's method for motor cortex electrodes. 
or. try a mouse with no electrodes and do extra cranial. 

- the silver wires are really no good noise picker uppers. 


1hr 40 into warming chamber. 

- Overall, I started with a decent connection, but at some point I had connectivity issue. 
- I could never get a good ae amplitude. 
- I coudl get an e stim electrical forepaw movement. The mouth electrode creates large whisker movements, I preferred the more focused paw only when the reference was in the visual cortex... 


Plan: 
- try eeg mouse on monday, if it works, then invest in surgery to create a mouse ready for an electrode plate over mep area instead. 

- David Bono's transformer box, seems to be working again. I think the harmonic are caused by that sudden transient jump. 

- Ok, new set up is with the transformer in place. 

- I did not use epcranial cup... as it won't fit.
