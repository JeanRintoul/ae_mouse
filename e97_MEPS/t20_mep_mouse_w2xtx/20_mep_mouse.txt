20_mep mouse with d bonos new current source. 
- mouse with one ptir wire at 0mm and 2.5mm screw.

ket = 3
k2=1
antidote = 6 (1:10) 
x = 1.5

1. anesthetize mouse and get in position.
2. hook up electrodes, using the thin silver wire as well. 
3. i am getting zero response... 

5k resistance between two cup electrodes... one in mouth, one on head. 

- the mouse has zero response... 

- 8k between the v1 and m1... 

im getting this strange current distribution


- i seem to be  not injecting a constant voltage... i do not know why. 

- i am not sure why i cannot inject a voltage. 

- wait - the tx does not output low freq voltages... 
- now it works at 499.998...  z = 393, i = 16ma. vpp = 12. 

--- - -- - - 
- interestingly the mouse response at8khz, but not at 100khz. 

480 ohm, 11ma, vpp=12v

- to test my mep ability, i need to do direct current stim too. 

5. we have a pretty big 2hz amplitude.. make pictures out of it. 0.11v acoustic. 12v out. gain = 200 , 6 seconds. 

6. 4hz df. 8 seconds. df pp = 290 microvolts... 

7. 1hz df. 8s. I seem to be getting ok amplitudes now, but i am not positioned correctly. 374 microvolts... this is pretty good. But I couldn't see a movement. 
make picture out of this one. make picture out of this. 

8. 277 microvolts. 

9. 2hz df. 

10. 2hz df, 426 microvolts... still cannot see anything. other electrode. 

11. i saw movements of tail and whisker... hooked to both electrodes. 

- - - 

12. df 2hz. 12v - i saw movement but hard to parse. 

13. 0v, but pressure. i see the same movements... 

14. 12v, no pressure. nothing.
