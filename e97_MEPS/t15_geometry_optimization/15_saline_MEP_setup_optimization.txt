t15 optimizing geometry for current density. 
===============================================================  

- two PtIr wires, 2mm apart. Still not that high a result. It is better than 5mm apart. 
   However, I can increase the current density here by increasing the surface area, or the voltage. 

- the carrier frequency is low, as I do not have the GND connected, and do not have the wire pick ups either. 

With David Bonos system, I keep seeing the sub harmonics all the time.. maximal mixing - it really doesn't seem that reliable.  


- the question with this last experiment, was why wasn't the screw a large enough surface area to inject a higher current? 


- check that I can see a 2Hz signal through the filter. I can not right now. Something is wrong. The filtered signal is still strange, it is 16hz instead of 8hz. 


Result: The higher surface area electrode seems better.
