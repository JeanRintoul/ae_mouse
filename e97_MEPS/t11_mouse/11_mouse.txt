t10 - try using the new style mouse,  isoflurane

Goal: Can I see the AE signal with the new style mouse? Yes
Can I calibrate position? Yes
If I can calibrate position, continue doing measurements over a one hour period, to track amplitude versus time. I didn't do this, but I did do a long series of demod measurements. 

= = = 

start: 13:40

I carefully set up the wires, placed tape at the back of the headbar, and repainted the wires with nail polish. Waited for nail polish to dry. 22 min start nail polish dry process. I put extra silicon on top of the motor cortex wire to try to insulate it further. 

First measurement: 139kohm. Turns out one of the silver wires became brittle and broke off. On replacement, I get 3.8kOhm. 
34 minutes in. 

No gel impedance measurement: 1v, 0.244 mA, 8khz, 3.78kOhm. 

1. With US gel, impedance go down to 2.7kOhm. 
Calibration: The amplitude appear very small. 

2-9 are the changing pressure with 1V out. 

The amplitudes are not huge. I think this has to do with the surface area, i.e. 

file 10-16 shows varying voltage. 

Question: What was the current output previously when I got high values? 

I think this was all to do with the exposed electrode surface area. 

I think that the result I am getting, is showing a dependence on the surface area of brain exposed to voltage, i.e. the current density. 

From this is seems that I should have the largest possible surface area exposed to do demodulation. 

Let's try some AE_DEMOD_VEPS. Gain = 500. filtering between 1Hz and 1M to help remove DC offset to reduce ovld. 4Hz LED. 
17 - 20. (with these settings a clear DC drift can be seen).

Neural recording with point PtIr electrodes. 

Now try with pressure v out = 0.11 (this is going to increase my noise floor )
Iso set a little lower: 0.8. frequency = 4hz(i.e. code set to 8) Gain = 500 due to OVLD of US frequency. 

21-41. Acoustically connected with mouse. 

46-70. Not acoustically connected to mouse. 

Note: The DC depression is completely gone when not acoustically connected. 

The VEP amplitude is bigger when no US connected. (do plot)

I need to do some current density saline experiments. Clearly the screws have a larger surface area, does this mean I was emitting more current previously? 

I got some noise from the heat mat(particularly during not acoustically connected).  
I think, but haven't measured yet that the amplitude of the VEP is larger when there is no acoustic connection. 

3 hrs 32 mins. mouse moved to warming chamber.
