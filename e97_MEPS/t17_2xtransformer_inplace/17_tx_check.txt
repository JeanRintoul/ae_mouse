t17- switch to transformer system
===============================================================  

Can I still calibrate with the bono 2x transformer in place? Yes. 

8khz, output fg = 1v. 

- z = 570, i = 2.9, vpp = 2.9, 
- I can still calibrate. I get a much higher current for the same voltage. 

when I go up to 12v output, vp  = 34.87, i(ma) = 23, z = 737. 
df = 139, sf = 133. 

So this is much better, using this transformer. 

However, I still need larger surface area electrodes to control the current density. 

Can I see low frequencies and accurately measure z, i etc? 


- 92Hz, i can see it when i use the preamp at 50 x amplification. I cannot see it in the raw voltages due to Johnson noise.

I also can't see other low dfs. This is still a problem. 


- todo: think about aliasing... and what is causing it.
