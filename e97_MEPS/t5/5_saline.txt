t5 - saline baseline testing with correct geometry to mimic mouse.
============================== 

Reference is located 5mm from the stimulation point to mimic the mouse geometry. It is located horizontally. 

ae_calibrate_with_ae_e97.py

I have a sample rate, aliasing issue which applies to stimulation. First calibrate position without creating a map. 

- Then, experiment with adding a filter so I can get frequency mixing. 
- Do a set of longitudinal measurements over time. 
- 

I am doing a rough calibration, and I am having trouble getting clear signal. I think this is because I have a horizontal field.

If I could calibrate and do stimulation with the mouth electrode as the counter point? It might make the AE signal so much larger. 

Calibrating horizontally is a bad plan. Maybe it is also because the electrode are close to the back.. they should be higher. This means I should also calibrate with a vertical field in the mouse. 

Was it about being vertical, or too close to a reflective back plate?

Saline test over 1 hour, at calibrated center point. 5mm distance between electrodes, vertically mounted. 
Amplitude over time. 8khz, vout = 3v, vacoustic = 0.1(1MPa). Fs = 5e6. duration = 4.0s.

RESULT: There is no trend with respect to time on the df amplitude. 

Test with gold cup electrode mounted on the bottom. 
26. 82, 419. Suddenly I got a higher value? 
Also, the 500khz value is no longer biforcated. Having a larger reference stim electrode that is vertically aligned seems generally positive. 

- Try to get a df at low frequencies... using a separate electrode and the filter and preamp(as I did in Uren). I can now see the difference frequency, at gain 1 df = 303. 

- If I use the preamp separately, and add gain, I can see the df at very low frequencies. 

There is too much noise at low frequencies to see the df clearly unless I use the gain. It gets buried in the noise as there are not enough repeats. I can't really see it in the raw v data, though I can see it if I use gain on the preamp with a filter in front. . 

Gain = 10 

26. df = 8hz. gain = 10
27. df = 7hz. gain = 10
28. df = 2hz. gain = 10

Move it a little to the right and left to verify this is indeed it is correct seeming. 

However, I think it is not ideal to use a separate measurement electrode to the stim electrode. 


For tomorrow: 
- set up the preamp so that I can use one electrode. i.e. i need to filter the measured voltage, then amplify it. 
- repeat the horizontal vs vertical alignment test, as this will determine whether I shift to this set up in the mouse. 

- Do a careful calibration with electrodes in whatever the 'winning' position and set up is.
