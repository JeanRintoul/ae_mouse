t1- saline test for ae magnitude effects of changing surface area and geometry. 
====================================================  

- make my way to the focus in each case, and then do p vs ae and e vs ae plots which include a current read out. 

- why is my carrier so high again, at 785 microvolts. or 1354? 
- it is mirroring what i see in vivo. I think this carrier amplitude has nothing to do with anything I am interested in, but risks causing an artefact mixing on any preamp.

Same 5mm apart. 
two PtIr wires, mounted horizontally. 
one screw and one PtIr wire. 

Result: The larger surface area stim electrode makes a MASSIVE difference. I am now getting results in saline that are larger than what I was getting in mouse, because I have a giant silver blob on my screw. 

The first couple of measurements were amazing, then something happened and they settled into a more stable size. This could be due to movement, or other. 

The impedance keeps changing. Something weird is happening... not sure if screw is moving or not. 

Distance test: 
Result: having the stim and reference closer together appears to increase the size of the effect. 

Artefact hunt: 
500kHz Artefact hunt: why is it big again? Should I even care? I should care because it gets in the way of my neural recording ability, providing an artefact. 

- disconnect the cable from the stalk. 

- the noise is on the gnd plane. When I disconnect the GND, the noise goes away. 
- it is also coming from the silver wire. I think I should use a twisted pair wire that has different colors so I can see it instead.

Try to repeat the first test with the screw where I got really high results? Maybe the surface area was made artificially larger somehow?
