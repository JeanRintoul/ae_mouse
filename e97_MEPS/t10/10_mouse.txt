t10 - try using the new style mouse,  isoflurane
====================================================  
p = 0.1(1MPa), vout e = 1V, f = 8khz
ae_calibrate_with_ae_e97.py 

- - 

Goal: Can I see the AE signal with the new style mouse? 
Can I see a VEP? 
Can I calibrate position? 
If I can calibrate position, continue doing measurements over a one hour period, to track amplitude versus time.

relatively pain free set up on all sides. 
gave it 0.25ml saline. 
put some nail polish on the top of thew wires, let it dry while doing vep testing. 
moved LED closer to eyes. In partial darkness 

TODO: I think I should try the previous reference position where I was getting better results.

1. impedance at 8khz: 5.5 kohm, 0.148ma. It is connected correctly. 
  - on second attempt impedance is too high. 
2. plain VEP (ae_demod_vep.py), with led frequency 2Hz(i.e. 4hz written in state machine). Powerboard for daqs unplugged from mains. 
It looks like neural activity, but I cannot tell the VEP is there as some have it and some do not. It seems to be about 200 microvolts in amplitude which is great, but the signal time series and fft itself is confusing and not convincing. 

3-10. Try 7 Hz VEP(i.e. 14hz written in thingo) a few times, so I can do averaging and post-processing later. Note: at file 6 i had to replug in the daqs due to data overflow issue. 
   Maybe I have a VEP processing error? ANALYZE THIS. 
I'm getting data overflow, I think it is because my computer is busy transferring data to NAS. I paused data transfer, and it suddenly worked.  
1 hr in. 

11. US calibration time. I am not sure I have a good connection as impedance is at 25kohm. I seem to have really high impedance. I am not sure if I can trust any results right now. 

I can see 100Hz up modulated. 

12. continue calibration. Something weird IS happening, as I can see freuquencies either side of 500khz + 100hz... 

I think the wires have common mode on them. Try twisting them together. 
And/or are shorted together else where

I move the transducer away, and I am still getting 500khz. This is because measurement cables too close. 

- Try without the silver wires. 
- I still get the weird biforcated signal. 
It is unclear that the silver wires are a problem. 

I should be able to recreate this signal, without a mouse. 

Recover the mouse. 
2k resistance, I don't think there is any short in this case. 

There was a short, due to the gel however. I may need to place some tape or some paper over the electrode connections, to avoid a short. 

2hrs 33 min under anesthesia. 12:30pm. 

So there was a short circuit when I tried to measure the acoustoelectric effect meaning I don't think I measured it. However, the mouse itself seems to have low impedance between the electrodes which seems promising. 


Did I get a VEP? 

13. saline test. I can see the df clearly here, as I do not have the current shorted between any other point. 

Clearly, I had a current shorting issue. 

My mouse recovered quickly, and looks great and ready for reuse. 2k impedance is good too. 

calibration in saline, horizontal is: 
1v, 8khz, horizontal .


It still works if you calibrate horizontal. 

I am getting overall slightly smaller amplitudes.
