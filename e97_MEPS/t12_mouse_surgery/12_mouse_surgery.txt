t11 - new mouse surgery
====================================================  

- MEP electrodes designed for highest mA throughput and high current density(2 screws close together).

- Try EEG electrode for demodulation, this should not degrade over time, and have better SNR due to slightly larger surface area. 

TODO: refill the de-ionised water.
