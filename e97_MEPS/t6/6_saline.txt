t6 - saline baseline testing, double check geometry configuration for calibration. 
====================================================================================  

- repeat the horizontal vs vertical alignment test, as this will determine whether I shift to this set up in the mouse. 
- Do a careful calibration with electrodes in whatever the 'winning' position and set up is. 


1. I got about 50 microvolts at the optimal position I could find with 2 electrodes spaced 5mm apart. 

Switching to the gold cup reference on the bottom, suddenly the df and carrier amplitude increase. The carrier has increased from 80 to 688 

This suggests that I should switch to a gold cup reference. 


positioning gold cup out of the focal region 59 and 415. 

positioning the gold cup on the side. df = 110?

it seems not so much about its position, but rather how close it is? 
Either way, the larger surface area seems reference like it enhances the amplitude of the ae effect. 

- How should I put a vertical reference, if the mouse is under isoflurane? 
  - shave bottom of chin? 

- Do a detailed map, at vout p = 0.1(1MPa), vout e = 1V, f = 8khz. Am I sure I cannot use a horizontal referencein the mouse? No I am not sure. It is definitely much easier if I can. 


- I think for stimulation it is better if I can have a vertical stim field. So that is with Ket/Xyl and involves the cup electrode. 
- For demodulation, the question remains whether I can do a position calibration in the mouse with some other horizontal referencing technique. i.e. attach a reference to the headbar itself? I think I will simply have to test this. 

The problem with doing a position calibration now, is that my noise level is high. I tried moving the daq range down to 2V, and indeed now I can see it clearly. 

Full position calibration at Vout = 1V, 8kHz, with gold cup electrode. I don't think it matters which electrode too much really. It will always be a bit approximate. 

Get lunch, then start. 

1v out, 8khz, 1MPa.
