t8 - in saline phantom test whether the silicon I'm using in the mouse, is acoustically transparent.

p = 0.1(1MPa), vout e = 1V, f = 8khz

It didn't fit into the headbar? 
It was a clump of cement at the back that was the problem. 

I still don't know what the impedance is. 

I could give it xylazine/ketamine. 
1.5 x
3 k 
- antisedan 6 (1:10) ready. 

After some adjustment, I got it in the headbar, albeit with some difficulty. 

1. The impedance is up way too high. No go. 
   It is possibhle that the silicon is shielding.

I got it down to: 7k which seems reasonable. 
13993
12k
3.7k - good connection. 

- TODO: add an impedance measurement into the protocol. 

Wait until the new silicon dries. It may be higher after the silicon dries? 

Next problem is the attachment and getting the US in there. 
This has not been solved. 

If the PtIR wire straight back, but attach silver wires. 

- - but then the grabbers have to grab somewhere, and just being at the back of the head means I cannot move the US back more. 

- Ideally I need to add the wires to the back of the head... which in turn connect to the minigrabbers. 

1 hr in, I moved to warming chamber and gave antisedan dose. 

END. 

I have found a set up that works. 3.75k impedance. No strain on mouse, full movement of US. 

Unclear of noise characteristics of this set up. However, this seems like a better option for long term signal stability for the mouse.
