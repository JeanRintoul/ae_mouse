t1 - 500khz meps with US position calibration. 
========== 

make a twisted pair cable with grabbers and BNCs.

To get rid of the issue where the applied voltage leaks into the carrier measurement, I move the frequency to 8khz.

I suspect there is something wrong with my cables. 

Calibration:
Today, I am getting really low values for the 500khz. 
Try changing cable. Suddenly the signal is far larger. The cables were a problem... 
This suggests that if I made the impedance adapter even better, I may get a larger result too. 

It's possible the impedance is different between my saline set up, and the mouse. 
The 500khz is also about the distance the transducer is away from the saline.

For phantom measurements, I should skip the straight cable, and go straight to the twisted cable. 

Changing the voltage amplitude in saline while keeping pressure constant. 
pressure = 1MPa, 0.1V out.

13. back to 6v out, since both times i get a peak df amplitude at this voltage. 

Change the pressure amplitude v out = 6.0V , 95 hz.

Double check that df is bigger at 6v than 12v.

There appears to be a sweet spot for both pressure and electric field to get a bigger amplitude? 

Now do df of 4Hz. Do I see anything at 20Hz? 6v out, 499996Hz. 8 second recording. 
24. I see nothing at 4Hz. I see something at 100Hz though. 
What frequency do I see the correct df frequency? 
25. 6v out, 499990Hz same problem. 
26. 499905hz, should be df at 95Hz. 
27. 499000Hzshould be df at 1000Hz.Nothing.  
I think I need to manually look at the time series data of these to understand what is going wrong. 

Uunplug the daqs to run on battery power. 
28. 499000Hz - nothing... 
29. 8000Hz

Ok lets try repeating this at a lower voltage. The output voltage is causing harmonic distortion because it goes past the max voltage range of the daq... That's why I am seeing things at frequencies I should not be. 
30. v out = 2v, 499990Hz I still cannot see it? 
31. repeat - nothing is there. 
32. 499905Hz, nothing is there. 
33. 
So... something is not right. 

Result, I need to double check all my daq ranges based on these measurements. 
Something is going wrong on my end. This is likely effecting my ability to do demod too. 

34. Plugged daqs back into mains. 8khz out. 

No difference. It seems highly likely I lost my calibration location through an accidental touch. 

END.
