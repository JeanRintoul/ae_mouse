- ensure that the two electrodes are not electrically connected via the gel. 

- calibrate position, using the VEP electrode as the current source, and two external to head references. 
- Perform F21, Kaiser windowed, and SNR averaged acoustoelectric neural recording. 
   Try at a couple of different VEP frequencies. 

To fit the plug on, I had to have it half hanging out of the neurotar at an angle. 
Not ideal. 

= = = = = = Start time: 10:06am = = = = = =  

- The implant connector coming back at an angle is BAD. cannot fit in neurotar. 
   This means i need to somewhat edit the connector, so I can fit it on straight, and get it into the VEP electrodes. 

VEPS for spike demodulation at 100kHz, gain = 500, no DC offset. 

F21 in place, Gain = 1000, 0.3Hz high pass on preamp, Duration = 12. Fs = 5e6.

running e136_ae_neural_recording.py 

- I seem to be having trouble calibrating, the maxima keeps changing location. I have the F21 in place here as well. 
- the amplitude is also quite small, but this may be due to how I am calibrating. Try it anyway. 

--- TODO: debug position calibration when I do it with this method. What am I actually doing here? What am I actually measuring? is the ae size actually small 

- neural recording. It looks like I am seeing the apodization still present from the kaiser window. 
  It is hard to tell if I am getting ae modulation or not. 
  gain = 1000. 0.3hz high pass. no other filters. 
- file 6 - may have a timing weird issue. the start peak appears wrong. 
- file 10 - also has a weird start peak. 
- file 17 - start peak is 59035563
- file 24 
- file 27 
- file 32 
- file 47
- file 52
- file 55

warming chamber after 2 hrs. 12:15am. 

TODO: check that my files have the pressure(and separately also test LED is perfect) perfectly time synced.
