t5 - acoustoelectric measured phantom
================================================== 
- gain = 100, with a high pass filter and 6khz applied field. 
- it does appear to be there, and it does have a rough focality. I am using the preamp.

- now to do it with a single electrode and no preamp. I have the advantage of already having found the focal point.  

- it is there, but it is very small and there are other artefacts nearby. I sort of needed to know where to look from my pre-calibration. 

Also, the transducer is far off center to what I thought it would be, suggseting I never got close to the focal point the other day due to this. 


Ok, I can do it with both methods as I could previously... 

Single electrode method I have daq range at 4v, vout = 1v. pressure = 1MPa. 

What I had wrong, is the offset... it is way over to the left...
