t5 - mouse with low isoflurane, and long duration recordings. 
=====================================================

- This time, I am using the non-twisted pair electrodes. 
- I am going to use a gain of 1000, or 2000. 
- VEP frequency 7hz and 10Hz to take it away from the 500kHz peak. 

- Do 30 reps. 
- turn off heat mat when recording? 
- also grounding, and complete darkness VEPs. 
- For calibration - place GND on other side nearby with direct conductive connection.

==========

1. 7hz vep, iso = 1, size = 8.5 microvolts. 16 p-p. That means it should be bigger if I turn down the iso. 

2. Calibrate US position. Calibration seemed shitty this time. Need to reset transducer so it sits straight. 
   Remove wires. 
   I left it at the position where it gave a higher signal, though it looks visually a bit off target. :/ 

3. ae neural recording. iso = 0.6, 1 hour into the recording time. 
   7hz led. p out = 0.12v. 30 second duration. gain = 1000. iso=0.6
   1hr 14 min into iso. 

   I can see the 7hz wings, but. they ARE close to the noise floor. What should I do? 5 microvolt VEP. Is this real, or just there anyway? SNR 14.5 dB

4. 10hz vep. gain = 2000, iso = 0.6.
I had to change the daq input range from 4V to 8V to prevent a saturated region. Previously it was at 4V range. 
First file has a clear 30Hz, which is up modulated successfully. Check it out. I could see it within a single file. 

2hr 10 minutes. start...  

- It looks like I got it at gain = 2000. 
3hrs 52 minutes in. 

5. Two tone test. 11 reps to match my 8Hz VEP data. 
   Finally, I set up the two tone test, for 30 seconds, gain = 2000. 
   I applied 8Hz, at a higher amplitude than what I have. 

   Wait- it is mixing. that's bad... is it the gain, the electrode position? what is causing this? 

   I separated the cables some- the two brain connected ones, and the mixing appeared to stop? One cable is the measurement cable, the other is sending in the 5hz. 

   I reduced the mixing issue somewhat... but not entirely... and did the 11 recordings at 30 seconds, gain = 2000. 

   TODO: I may need to refine how to do this in the phantom. 

Two tone mixing test failed. This could be a whole variety of reasons, and it is not synonymous with the VEP test... 

Finish 4 hrs 50 mins, 15:33.

- I think I should try with the transducer I can visually focus. 672.8khz
