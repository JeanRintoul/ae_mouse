t8 - phantom.  
===================================

- phantom test, measuring the acoustoelectric effect with and without a GND on the ultrasound transducer. 
- what is the maximum amplitude I can generate with AE MEPs? 
- phantom test with 4 wires arranged in a row, for ionic mixing in electrolytes? 

= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = 

1. set up the ultrasound. 

2. Set up a phantom with a current generation, and distant reference. 

3. When I put the switch in place, I changed the impedance. 

3 folders, each with 5 files: 

I am applying 0.4 V which appeared to calibrate ok. 

Switch on and connected: 
750 microvolts at df, and 622198 at the center f p-p. 

Switch off and connected: 
15 microvolts, 50000 at the center peak. 

Switch removed: 10 microvolts at df, 11639 at carrier p-p. 

Is the df focal, when it is so high with the switch connected? 

The impedance may vary with temperature and cable position etc. The impedance of the cable makes a giant difference to the voltage measured in the medium. Having the switch OFF i.e. removing the GND, makes this signal huge. 

But now, it is NOT focal. There is electrical mixing just with itself. Perhaps some acoustoelectric mixing too but that would be much smaller. 

Without GNDING, I lose focality. Phantom t2. 

Phantom t3: Wait - right now nothing has focality? what is going on? 

stop.. try again another day.. maybe a different wire set up. 

RESULT: removing the ground massively increases the df amplitude. However, focality is lost. 

Day 2: This time repeat the US GNDING focality experiment, except use a higher current frequency, so that I can filter out the 500kHz area, and just look at remnant low frequency info. This means I could apply a higher current to see focality more clearly. 

1. focus calibration is working. current f is 491khz. 
Raw focused ultrasound. 6 second duration, low pass filter. 

suddenly not working... now it seems terrible... so the calibration is pretty random right now. Maybe it has to do with the fact I taped the measurement electrode to the stim electrode so they are close together? 

I rearranged the electrodes such that the stim electrode(thick metal) is on one side of the measurement set. 


aah.. when the US isn't perfectly gel connected... I get this weird amplitude effect.

I seem to get better focality repeatability in the vertical direction, where the wire is NOT. 
The problem is because the GND is far away from the stim source... meaning the e field localization is broader. 
Also, the high e field goes everywhere? 

If I put the stim and GND close together, I can map it. 



To calibrate: 
- So, the US gel column needs to entirely connect at the end of the cone.

The neuromodulation response: 
Is it ionic mixing, or the acoustoelectric effect?
