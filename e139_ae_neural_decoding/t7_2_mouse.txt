t7 - 3 test ae neural recording. 
===================================

Attempt at a full test. If this works, I can then repeat it in n=6 mice. 

VEP at 10Hz
Calibration

3 tests:
1. frequency specificity test 8Hz and 10Hz VEP with US at 1MPa. v out = 0.1. 10x repeats of each. 30 seconds duration of each. 
2. focal location, versus 4mm to the right and 4 mm forward(outside of the locus of the visual cortex). 10x repeats. Is there a difference in amplitude here between the modulated VEP at focus versus not? 
3. Two-tone test: to prove f mixing not occuring in the preamp. Remove the US, place electrodes such that the measurement electrodes and stim electrodes are at 3 separate levels.

- This time, I am using the non-twisted pair electrodes. 
- I am going to se a gain of 2000. 
- VEP frequency 8Hz and 10Hz to take it away from the 500kHz peak. 
- VEPs in darkness.

==============================



TODO: mark on the two electrode cable more clearly. 
clean up my disk space. 

1. 10Hz VEP, Iso = 0.75, 4 microvolts, 8p-p

2. calibrate. The stim and gnd are quite close, using the thick wire electrodes. The values are smaller. The center point could calibrate, but it was in a surprising place. The US looks like it is off to the side... but... this is where the max is. Perhaps the cone is crooked? 

3. ae neural recording. 10Hz. p out = 0.1V. I got it. It works. 
4. ae neural recording. 8Hz. p out = 0.12V. It wasn't very clear. Maybe? 
5. vep 10hz, p out = 0.12, mb... at the noise floor... not great... but maybe a little bit there. 

6. side by side test. move to the right 4mm, move forward 4mm. Then repeat 10Hz test. 
  p vout = 0.1. iso = 0.6. I can see the 20 and 30 in there. This didn't work. 
  What does this mean though? It means that I am picking up noise through the cables. The 500kHz in the cables... is mixing. I mean with the gel column it may be reflecting. What I can do is do the acoustic disconnection? Then we know there is no traversing acoustic field. Second attempt worked. 

  So, perhaps I do need to watch out for the gel reflection. It may still be working. 
  The alternative is the not acoustically connected test. This test is likely to have less capacitive coupling in it anyway. 

7. not acoustically connected. pvout = 0.1. I still see a large 500khz, but I do not see the mixing occuring. vep = 10hz. This works. No mixing to be seen. 

8. two-tone test. I used the twisted pair cable as the measurement cable... I think this is non-ideal. but whatever. Maybe it was successful. My 500khz was a bit small. No 10Hz around the carrier. Though carrier was only at 768 microvolts. 

So... maybe it DOES work? 

3 hrs 28 mins under iso. 16:38 into warming chamber. 

end. 

- All tests are passed... but some may have subtleties... 
  This is always the way.
