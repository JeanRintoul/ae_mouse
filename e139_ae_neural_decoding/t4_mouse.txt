t2 - mouse with low isoflurane, and long duration recordings. 
=====================================================

- This time, I am using the non-twisted pair electrodes. 
- I intend to do a larger number of reps, but otherwise the same as t2. 
- If there is time, try a couple of different frequencies. 

- turn off heat mat when recording? 
- also grounding, and complete darkness VEPs. 
- For calibration - consider placing the GND nearby? 

Isoflurane. m1 mouse. 
Date of experiment: 26/03/2024  
Mouse Cage: 127972
Number of uses before: 2
Gender: male
Weight: 28.4g including headbar.

TODO: watch the O2 cylinder as it is only at 50 right now. 

1. 4hz vep, iso = 0.6, 12.4 microvolts, 25 peak to peak. Single predominant peak at 4Hz. 

2. Calibrate US position. 
   Remove wires. 

3. ae neural recording. iso = 0.5, 1 hour into the recording time. 
   4hz led. 
   30 files. 
   p out = 0.12. 
   gain = 500. 
   arms are moving. 

4. same as 3, except with 7hz led. GAIN = 1000. 
   I had to stop at file 5, and up the isoflurane as it was moving too much, i then decreased it back to 0.6. The size at 7Hz is TINY. 


END 2hr, 40 mins under iso. 14:26. 

- change over the 02 canister. 
- i think the screw IS a good idea, to increase the surface area that picks up current. 

I think I got it, but I will have to double check to make sure. Down at 0.002 microvolts...

When I took it out of the warming chamber, there was a small amount of blood, which I think was due to it waking up too much and struggling. 


Results:
The recording where gain = 1000 seems better... in that maybe... i can almost see a 7Hz wing.
