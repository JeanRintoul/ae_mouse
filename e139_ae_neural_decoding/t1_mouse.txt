t1 - mouse with low isoflurane, and long duration recordings. 
=====================================================

- turn off heat mat when recording? 
- also grounding, and complete darkness VEPs. 
- For calibration - consider placing the GND nearby? 

Isoflurane.

I seem to have fixed the heat mat noise issue by covering it with tape. 

1. veps iso = 0.75, 2hz , 20 microvolts VEP. It is small but there. i.e. 40 microvolts pp. also some signal at 34Hz? 

3. calibration. still not really working, values going all over the place with the gnd placed underneath. I put the GND litely at the edg of the neurotar, not all the way through. I seem to be calibrating ok... with the GND wire just touching the neurotar. 
The connection seems not that good... goes in and out. Need an easy way to connect it.

My VEP is super small - this is the problem: 
4. gain = 500. 3hz LED. iso = 0.6 ae neural recording. p v = 0.12 
   6 times. 30 seconds. 

5. gain = 500. 2hz LED. iso = 0.6 ae neural recording. p v = 0.12 
   6 times. 30 seconds. 

6. 2hz led again. iso = 0.5 for all but the first file. I left heat mat on here. 

7. 3hz ae neural recording same settings as 4. iso = 0.5  - signal super low and crap here.. nothing to write home about. 
- remember to look at these files around 34hz for isoflurane signal there. 

Post process with all 10 files together to improve snr. 

finish 2 hrs in.

- it is possible i got it here... but i need a bigger VEP to know for sure. 
- my real problem, is the size of my VEP when doing the measurement. tHIS IS not due to the US, but the anesthesia level.  
- i think the earlier files may have larger 34 hz. 

TODO: analysis.... 
The initial files may have larger 34 Hz signal. 

Analysis result, no veps except some 3Hz ones - 3hz_aevep2 -> file 2,4 
- everything else is useless. 

On the good side - calibration appeared to work relatively well this time. 
Need an effective way to position the GND electrode...
