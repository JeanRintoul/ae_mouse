t1 - df size using the rf amplifier instead of the tx.  
=======================================================

Running rf_ti_rfamplifier_test.py
gain = 1000
low pass at 10k, high pass at 0.3

RF amplifier, gain = 1000, 
carrier 2Mhz
1. vout =0.05
2 0.1 -
3 0.15 -
4 0.2 -
5 0.25 - 
6 0.3 - 
7 0.4 - 
8 0.5 

Added new PRF code to do PRF 1020 equivalent test. 
Result: PRF does not lead to higher amplitude mixing. 
I should use two sine waves instead. 

What I did see, was that I didn't get arnold tongues at 500kHz. I just got the intended mixing frequency. 
Hence, I could experiment with going to a higher amplitude with the rf amplifier? 

500khz carrier, vout = 0.6 
9. 1500 amplitude df. The biggest yet. 

So, using the RF amplifier does give additional freedom for the signal amplitude. 
It seems that a particular setting on the antenna works better at 500kHz(the same setting as I was using for 2mHz)
Do a secondary recording set at this for 500khz. 

10. vout =0.05
11 0.1 -
12 0.15 -
13 0.2 -
14 0.25 - 
15 0.3 - 
16 0.4 - 
17 0.5 - 
18 0.6 

Overall, I can control the signal and it's amplitude best at 500kHz, using the RF amplifier.
