t3 - picture of output signal. 
=======================================================

Here I attach a t connector to the current output generator, so I can get nice plots of the output signals equivalent to 

run rf_ti_hf_test.py 

1. Ch1 is the output waveform (here I use 500kHz) so I don't get aliasing effects on the recording. (just for imagery plots.)

2. 10Hz direct. ch 1 is the one to look at for the output data. 

END.
