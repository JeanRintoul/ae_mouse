t1 - Ionic mixing. 
================================================== 

Running rf_ti_hf_test.py

Use the 10Mhz Fs fg, 5MHz recording Fs, 2Mhz carrier frequency. 
Start with de-ionized moving into higher salinity. 

Electrodes positioned so they touch the bottom of the petri dish each time, filled to the same level each time. No barrier between liquid and antenna. 

Test options: 
Deionized. 
2.2g (0.45%)
4.5g (0.9%) 
1.8% 9g

Question: Does frequency mixing amplitude trend with salinity? 

preamp settings (0.3hp, 10k low-pass) gain = 1000
5mm apart PtIr probe, on bottom of petri dish. 
vout = 12(max), Fs = 10MHz, df = 10Hz, carrier = 2MHz. 
Do I see any frequency mixing? I do. There is a clear 5mm air gap between the liquid and the antenna. 

1-5. de-ionized water.  (40 microvolts)

I use the stereotax to keep the high the same for each petri dish. 

6-10. 2.2g (0.45%) (73 microvolts)

11-15. 4.5g (0.9%)  (78) and also a large sub-harmonic at 5Hz. analyze. i.e file 13. 

16-20. 9g (1.8%) (87) and also a large sub-harmonic at 5Hz about half-height of first harmonic. (does this relate to the arnold tongues stuff?)

21-25. 1.1g (0.225%) (63) - the variance seems higher at this salinity. I can still see the 5Hz however. 

The amplitude of mixing trends with salinity. This should make a pretty clear plot. 

- - - 
Also do 10Hz direct stim test - does anything get through with all same settings? 
[ compare 26-30 with 31-35]
26-30. 10 Hz directly, 12v out. The tx does some weird spikes, but nothing comes out at 10Hz. 
31-35. 10Hz via RF TI. i.e. 2Mhz carrier, 10Hz df. 

at 0.9% saline: 
At the end, do the single ended vs differential non-linearity test. 

36-37. Go back to preamp, remove filters to see ratio of hf signal to df signal. The signal at gain = 1 appears 0.1V in height... hence I cannot amplify it too much without OVLDing the preamp. 
carrier = 2Mhz. 
However, I can still see the DF, so this should do for creating a transmittance function. 

- - - transfer function when I apply different carrier frequencies but keep the difference frequency at 10Hz? i.e. the transmittance plot. This plot also contains the df proportional to the input amplitude. 

ae_rf_transmitter_transfer_function.py in 0.9% saline. 
apply 2 frequencies, df apart and see how amplitude changes with carrier. 
gain        = 5, no filters on preamp. vout = 10. 

- - - change the vertical distance and see how the amplitude falls off with distance. 
preamp gain = 5, vout = 12, 2MHz carrier. 10Hz df. no preamp filters. differential measurement. 

38. starting about 7mm from the liquid. 
distance(dv-mm) df(microvolts)
positive means going up and away from the liquid. 

0, 126.7, 140.5, 157.6, 144.93
5, 106.7, 120.77, 112.38, 110.0

50, 98.27, 101, 89, 97.67, 87

So yes, there does seem to be a trend of decreased amplitudes, though it is fairly slow to fall off.
