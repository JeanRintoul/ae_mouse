t1 - acoustoelectric neural recording amplitudes with PRF test. 
=================================================================

Goal: Test whether the acoustoelectric effect scales with impedance, with the largest impedance being at the lowest frequencies. Do this by changing the PRF. 

Set up: A petri dish with saline. On the implant one electrode is the measurement electrode, the other the stim electrode. Then the GND for the signal and the reference for the differential measurement are otherwise attached to the side of the petri dish and are normal wires. Thus I have a distance reference for the measurement, and the field propagates only over one electrode(the one on the implant) as the GND is on the other side of it. 

Pressure at 1MPa? 
Using SR560. 

- I have calibrated position, using US gel. Using a 492khz electric signal. 
- This creates an electric field at 8khz. 

- My amplitude theory, is that the PRF amplitude should be larger, or that a low frequency mixed with it should be larger the lower the PRF? It isn't true, I cannot visually see mixing anywhere. 

duration: 8s, Fs = 5e6. Gain = 500. 
- I cannot see any frequency mixing anywhere. 


PRF trend. (no applied current field)
Preamp is 0.1-10khz filtered. 
PRF 1020: 16 microvolts.
PRF 220: 14 microvolts.
PRF 80: 13 microvolts.
PRF 40: 18 microvolts.
PRF 10: 101 microvolts. 
PRF 5: 249 microvolts. 
PRF 2: 373 microvolts. 
PRF 1: 742 microvolts. - this is big enough to induce neuromodulation. 

Neuromodulation is caused by the DC offset induced by the US? 

If I put the electrical F21 shield material, what do these amplitudes look like for prf amplitude?  

PRF 1020: 10
PRF 220: 10
PRF 80: 8.89
PRF 40: 9.54
PRF 10: 50.8
PRF 5: 108.09
PRF 2: 156.4
PRF 1: 291.6

Try adding an electric field that is the same as the pressure field: 
vout = 1V. (no amplification it is just directly applied) 

PRF 1020: 97.95
PRF 220: 101.5
PRF 80: 102.01
PRF 40: 80
PRF 10:92
PRF 5: 150 - there is a tall spike at the beginning ... what is it's amplitude? This may be filter artefact. 
PRF 2: 173
PRF 1: 271.13

What if I apply the e field continuously instead of copying the p field? This is not that good. 
PRF 1020: 25
PRF 220: 
PRF 80: 19
PRF 40: 
PRF 10: 50
PRF 5: 
PRF 2: 135
PRF 1: 242

Try adding an electric field that is the same as the pressure field: (perhaps try this again with increased data range?)
vout = 3V. (no amplification it is just directly applied) 
PRF 1020: 1016.77
PRF 220: 1013.12
PRF 80: 1015.6
PRF 40: 813.67
PRF 10: 830.44
PRF 5: 1014
PRF 2: 698
PRF 1: 840

No F21, and 3V applied PRF field. 
PRF 1020: 1370.9
PRF 220: 1394
PRF 80: 1388
PRF 40: 1124.4
PRF 10: 1133.5
PRF 5: 1383
PRF 2: 958
PRF 1: 1187

TODO: Plot the PRF trend, with F21, and with F21 plus direct applied e field. 
The trend with PRF is different when I manually apply an e field, though I am apparently making the amplitude at the PRF larger. 

E field, 3V, no pressure. 
PRF 1020: 
PRF 220: 1338
PRF 80: 
PRF 40: 
PRF 10: 1081
PRF 5: 
PRF 2: 850
PRF 1: 942

Try straight demodulation of a small signal with a continuous US wave. 
300 microvolts signal at 10Hz at various frequencies. 

26 Hz, I can see it up there... 
10Hz, I can see it. it is small. 1.6 microvolts. The US electrical signal is a bit in the way due to spectral leakage. 
4Hz, I cannot see due to giant US signal. 

Do I see an improvement when I use F21 in the demodulated signal? It should decrease the electrical noise. Gain to 1000. 
4Hz, cannot see. 
10Hz, maybe there but TINY. 
26Hz, there but tiny. 

F21 doesnt appear to be helping. It seems to be making everything worse. 

Add a high pass filter 10k high pass. Gain to 2000. 
26Hz, yes look small though. 
10hz, yes 
4Hz, yes

remove the filter. 
26hz, 
10hz, 
4hz, 
It is there... 
Continuous US is the way to do demodulation. 
The signal IS small. 

When I do a test, I should get a recording without the VEP occuring, and normalize by this spectrum. i.e. subtract this spectrum. 


RESULTS: 
1. I don't think the PRF based neural demodulation works. This invalidates all of the literature to date. I do think demodulation via spikes works. 
2. demodulation with a continuous wave does work but it is very small. 













- Do a pure sine wave US and can I see the mixing up at 500khz?
