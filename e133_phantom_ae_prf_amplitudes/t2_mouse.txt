t4 - acoustoelectric neural recording with ketamine. 
=================================================================

Ket/Xyl
drugs:
antidote: 5.6
X: 1.4
k1: 2.1
k2: 1.0
saline: 50

Date of experiment: 03/01/2024  
Mouse Cage: 112184
Number of uses before: 9
Gender: male
Weight: 32.4g including headbar. 
DOB: 6.05.2023

There is a lot of building work noise in the background, data quality may be bad. 
This mouse also has weird stuff on head, unsure if it is going ok. N. watson from downstairs has put a red tag on the cage due to concern. 

Gain = 500, no filters. 8s duration. 

Spike demodulation: 
- 10x vep 4hz
- 10x vep 1hz
- 10x vep 1hz with aluminum foil shield. 
- 10x vep 4hz with aluminum foil shield.

- US neural recording set up. 
I couldnt calibrate... as I need like.. an electric field to do ae calibration. . 
The ultrasound is leaking. I tried calibrating from the look of the US peak, and if I could see the modulated VEP. 

10 x (5Hz VEP) should have peaks at 10 and 20Hz. 
10 x no VEP, to get the baseline spectrum of US. 

I need a high pass filter so i dont get massive drift. 
added 0.3Hz HP.
