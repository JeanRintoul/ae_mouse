Spike demodulation (LED no US):

- 10x vep 1hz

Acoustoelectric Neural Recording with position calibration: 
1. use a second set of electrodes on head to generate acoustoelectric field around 1 measurement electrode, at 498khz field. 

2. run e133_ae_neural_recording.py 
   at 1Hz and 4Hz. Consider running for 12 seconds. 
   Fs = 2MHz or 5MHz is fine.

- woke up after the anesthesia, despite injecting with ket and xyl. 
- mouse is not completely asleep at 6 minutes 38 s despite injections being given 4 minutes ago. Eventually mouse movements slowed down, but it took a long time. Perhaps I didn't get it IP this time? 
- did VEP 4Hz and 1Hz for spike demodulation paper. 
- I seem to have weird heat mat noise right now. Maybe this is because moisture between temp probe and heat mat? 


Try calibrating position with the additional set of electrodes. 
- calibration with external set of electrodes def didn't work. 
- calibrated by eye. 


0.3Hz high pass. gain = 1000. Fs = 2MHz. 
1. vep 4hz. I might see something? 8 seconds. Fs 5MHz. Analyze this. 
2. vep 4hz, 12 second duration. Fs 5MHz. Didnt see any VEP. not even in original signal. 
3. vep 4Hz, 12 second duration. Fs 2MHz. No VEP?
4. vep 4hz, no US. I am simply not seeing a VEP. all signals henceforth ar 2MHz. 
5. no LED, just US. 
6. VEP 2Hz. no US. so I'd expect 4hz and 8hz peaks. It's tiny and there. maybe 4 microvolts at 4hz. 
7. VEP 2Hz. no US. I am not measuring a VEP right now. I think it is due to shorting of the electrodes through the gel. 
8. VEP 2Hz US. 
9. VEP 2Hz, US, PRF = 5000. 12s. Fs 2MHz. Cannot see any underlying VEP. 
10. small small VEP. really nothing to write home about. 
11. half amplitude pressure at 0.05. VEP 2Hz. no VEP. 
12. VEP is back when I dont use pressure. 
13. US PRF 120, US out 0.05. 2Hz VEP. Analyze this. Is there a VEP? yes but small. 
14. Continuous wave 0.05 out. 2hz VEP. 
15. Continuous wave 0.05 out. 4hz VEP. 
16. Continuous wave 0.1 out. 4hz VEP. VEP is there but v small. 
17. Continuous wave 0.1 out, 4hz VEP. 
18. repeat. this one looks like it has something a bit in FFT. 


So, I think what I need... is just a bigger VEP to do this. 

Note: for a large part of this I had the LED running only for 8 seconds of the 12. 

It's possible my measurement electrodes are both going through the gel and not through the head as I made a gel mistake at the start. This seems to be making my signal much smaller. 

In this experiment, I have noise in my measurement signal, and my VEP amplitude is small. Try unplugging preamp.

- Does ultrasound inhibit VEPs?
