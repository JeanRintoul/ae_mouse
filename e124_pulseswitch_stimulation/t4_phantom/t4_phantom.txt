t1 - RF antenna with the RF amplifier mouse test. 
================================================== 

Phantom Baseline to show my result is not a processing artefact. 

Donut RF Antenna.
vout = 0.8 
Preamp 10k low pass. Gain = 500.

- I have now implemented jitter (0.4 seconds), so that the timing is different for each pulse. This should improve my SNR. 
- I plan to do 40 recordings of each type of stimulation with the RF antenna. (i.e. 200 pulses)
- Using a higher amplitude pulse i.e. vout = 0.8. 

Then post-process these to ideally see the ERP clearly and with good error bars.
