Isoflurane Anesthesia at 0.5. Donut RF Antenna.

Preamp 10k low pass. Gain = 500.

- I have now implemented jitter (0.4 seconds), so that the timing is different for each pulse. This should improve my SNR. 
- I plan to do 40 recordings of each type of stimulation with the RF antenna. (i.e. 200 pulses)
- Using a higher amplitude pulse i.e. vout = 0.8. 

Then post-process these to ideally see the ERP clearly and with good error bars. 

= = = = = = = = = = 

iso = 0.6. Pressure out amplitude = 0.8, jitter = 0.4.

51-100. fswitching 

Consider doing some high anesthesia reps of each as a comparison. 

101-111 pulse, high anesthesia. iso = 1.6 

111-121 fswitching, high anesthesia. iso = 1.6 

= = = do fswitching low anesthesia more reps. 

iso = 0.5 vout = 0.6
121-141. fswitching  
   A click occured at the air con unit at this time. Something turned on, then off again. 

END. red wire on motor cortex side, on +ve input of preamp. So no sign change necessary. 
 - 1hr 30 minutes under anesthesia.
