t3 - RF antenna with the RF amplifier mouse test. Reps and jitter. Mouse with MEP electrode 2mm ML. 
================================================== 
Date of experiment: 16/11/2023  
Mouse Cage: 116345
Number of uses before: 8
Gender: male
Weight: 34.5g plus headbar. 
DOB: 6.05.2023

Isoflurane Anesthesia at 0.5. Donut RF Antenna.

Preamp 10k low pass. Gain = 500.

- I have now implemented jitter (0.4 seconds), so that the timing is different for each pulse. This should improve my SNR. 
- I plan to do 40 recordings of each type of stimulation with the RF antenna. (i.e. 200 pulses)
- Using a higher amplitude pulse i.e. vout = 0.8. 

Then post-process these to ideally see the ERP clearly and with good error bars. 

= = = = = = = = = = 10:44am start 
I have moved to the side one top part of the neurotar, so i can get the antenna closer to the head. 

iso = 0.5. Pressure out amplitude = 0.8, jitter = 0.4. 

1-40. fswitching. iso = 0.5
  At intervals the mouse moved a lot. I paused and put the iso up for a bit each time. 
  Some files may have too much movement in them. particularly around file 35-36. 

41-81 high anesthesia. iso = 1.6 

81-121 low anesthesia. iso = 0.5 

121-161 high anesthesia. iso = 1.6

Total time under iso: 1hr 42 minutes.
