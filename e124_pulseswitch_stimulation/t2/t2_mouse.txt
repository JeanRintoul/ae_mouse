t1 - RF antenna with the RF amplifier mouse test. 
================================================== 
Date of experiment: 15/11/2023  
Mouse Cage: 122184
Number of uses before: 0
Gender: male
Weight: 34.5g plus headbar.

Isoflurane Anesthesia at 0.5. Donut RF Antenna.

Preamp 10k low pass. Gain = 500.

- I have now implemented jitter (0.4 seconds), so that the timing is different for each pulse. This should improve my SNR. 
- I plan to do 80 recordings of each type of stimulation with the RF antenna. Do low anesthesia 40 reps, high anesthesia 40 reps, low anesthesia 40 reps, high 40 reps. 400 repeats of each data type to make for an excellent ERP. 
- Using a higher amplitude pulse i.e. vout = 0.8. 

Then post-process these to ideally see the ERP clearly and with good error bars.

red cable over motor cortex, start 10:22am
iso = 0.5, vout = 0.8, fswitching. 

1-40. (lights off so mouse feels relaxed)

iso = 2.0 (with lights on mouse belly to monitor breathing rate)
at file 54 i moved it down to iso = 1.5 as 2.0 seemed too slow a breathing rate.
41-80. 

iso = 0.5 
81-120. 

iso = 2.0 went to 1.5 iso at file 131. 
121 - 160.

I should have lots of reps, 
anesthesia and no anesthesia. 

Ideally I can get a good comparison from this data.
