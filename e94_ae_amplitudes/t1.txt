AE amplitudes test. 
======
Ephys mouse. 
using ae_calibrate_with_ae.py

frequency at 499905 (i..e 95 Hz difference frequency).

1. calibrate position. 
2. once I find a position, do repeated ae amplitude tests at a range of frequencies. 
3. lift the transducer, take a measurement when there is an air gap to show artefact test is valid. 

= = = 

start: 11am

current amplitude 2v, frequency 499905hz. vout = 0.1v(pressure). recording duration = 4s. 
attempting to leave 2 minutes between stims. 

Note: the sum frequency is much larger... this is likely due to having more samples to average? 

1. 348 microvolts at 95Hz. 
2. 951 microvolts. 
3. 414 microvolts. 
4. 868 microvolts 
5. 970 microvolts. 


trying a few different frequencies, at the point that I found was good. 

70Hz.
6. 252
7. 1072
8. 961

2000Hz
9.  636
10. 1738
11. 1520

499.905Hz (i.e. df at 95Hz)
12. 1617
13. 720 
14. 295

artefact test, adding an air gap. f applied = 499.905khz
15. 8.7    noise floor. 
16. 4.5
17. 2


VEP attempt: 7Hz, same location. Thonny loaded up with some other 'main'. It appears slower than 7Hz. 
18-24. 3.2 times per second. 

25 I cannot even see the 7Hz VEP. 

26-30. remove filters, gain down to 100 to avoid overload. 7hz vep. 
 post-analyze


my filtering in this code ae_demod_vept is truly bad. what is going on here?
