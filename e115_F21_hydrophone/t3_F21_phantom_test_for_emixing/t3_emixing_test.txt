t3 - F21 electrical mixing test
====================================================== 
Date: 10/10/2023

Switched to older style, close together, no nail polish electrode. What do the amplitudes look like when PRF calibrate? 
File 1. PRF 1020 (no preamp filters but using preamp gain = 1 )
- I can confirm that the amplitudes of the raw signal are simply much larger. 
  This points to some sort of mechanical failure mode of the ultrasound. 
- I think frequency mixing is occurring in solution due to the high voltages applied. 

carrier at 102526 microvolts, 

File 2: F21 applied. Preamp, gain = 1. 
- carrier at 14459 microvolts. 
  df = 159
  sf = 214. 

Run aemeps_prf.py 6 second duration. 
Since I am applying an electric field directly around 500kHz, put a low pass filter on the preamp. cut off 300Hz. 
Current amplitude = 2V. 
3. The amplitude at 10Hz is over 3000 microvolts. I can also see it in the spike data. 

4. low voltage to get 900 micrvolt 10Hz 1.5V on current. gain = 1, no filters on preamp. 
   pressure 0.1v out. 
5. What is the amplitude of the applied 500kHz electrical signal? TO determine this - turn off the voltage. 6855 microvolts at the 500khz center frequency. 

6. Turn off the RF amplifier, plug in another voltage output to the pressure function generator and tune it to provide 6855 microvolts. 
  With 0.42V I have it at 6900 microvolts. 

Note: I have the voltage sources on opposite sides, so they minimally interfere with each other. 

7. The actual mixing test. Amplitudes are the same as what I am seeing with the ultrasound. Add back the other voltage source at 1.5V, as I was using with the ultrasound. 

   - I am not seeing mixing the way I am when I apply ultrasound. 

Makes some repeats of this. 
7,8,9,10. 

This shows that the mixing is NOT happening due to electrical mixing. 

Repeats with US transducer, same settings as electrical test ready for comparison. 
11,12,13,14 

10Hz is super clear... (file 12 would make a nice plot)

- measure the df amplitude at a range of frequencies. (so I can compare against the mouse). 
df = 1hz, 
df = 2hz, 
df = 5hz 
df = 10hz
df = 40hz
df = 100hz. 

Preamp with 300Hz low pass filter cut off so as to see the 10Hz without the other stuff. 
v out = 2V for extra amplitude. Gain = 1 here. 
NOTE: focus not calibrated as it doesnt seem to matter. 

15,16,17,18. dfx = 1 
19. dfx = 2 
20. dfx = 5
21. dfx = 10 
22. dfx = 40
23. dfx = 100

24. v only  (dfx = 100)
25. p only  

END

Problem 1: the electrical characteristics of my transducer have suddenly changed. 
  - I sent an email to precision acoustics. 

  This means I have a higher electrical output. I am not sure why. However, it doesn't seem to be hindering my actual electrical mixing test... so let's go ahead?
