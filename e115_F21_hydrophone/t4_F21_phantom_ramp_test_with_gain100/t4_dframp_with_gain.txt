t3 - F21 with df ramp and preamp gain. 
====================================================== 
Date: 11/10/2023

The goal of this test, is to use an equivalent gain and filter as the mouse, to see if the spikes I saw were artefacts or not. 

Wait a second, I used a 300hz filter in the mouse... that means I filtered OUT the spikes? 

Do this test with:
1. 300hz low pass filter. 

Use F21.

1v output(because more ovlds). run aemeps_prf.py. 
Gain = 100, low pass = 300Hz. Using F21. 
1. 1Hz
2. 2Hz
3. 5
4. 10
5. 40
6. 100

The noise coming from the transducer is so high, that it limits where I can put the filter cut off, and how high I can up the gain. 

I can see however, that I see 'spiking' in this equivalent data. 
That means, that the spiking I saw before in the mouse, is less likely to be real. 

This is equivalent data. So I can analyse and compare with mouse. 
I do believe something is wrong with the transducer though.

Measure transducer cone position, I get a similar amplitude wherever I go. 
I think this means it is due to e f mixing instead. I did always get that when I applied the e field in this way however... so unclear.
