t5 electric field with hydrophone. 
====================================================== 
Date: 20/10/2023

The goal of this test is to show whether the electical output signal from the RF amplifier induces frequency mixing. 

Run ae_calibrate_with_prf3.py 
I cannot pump the voltage up to the height of the RF amplifier when outputing acoustic field... 

It doesn't really make sense to inject a big signal from the RF amplifier after all. 
How about I inject the signal amplitude that I see at 500khz in the other plot? 

Then I can go back to using the bonotx, and the preamp. 


Gain at 100, no preamp filters.
