t5 electric field with hydrophone. 
====================================================== 
Date: 20/10/2023

The goal of this test is to show that the hydrophone picks up electric signals too. 

Run ae_calibrate_with_prf2.py 
vout = 2 v (with d bonos tx )
1. You can clearly see the electric field measured via the hydrophone. 

2. v out = 4 (i.e. 8v pp).You can clearly see the electric field around 500khz. 
   BUT! you cannot see the mixing frequencies at the sum. 

3-5. repeat of file 2. 8v pp applied in rf resonator form.(no gnd)

 A hydrophone converts acoustic signals to electric signals, but as it is a submerged electrical amplifier it also simply picks up electrical signals. 

We show here that the hydrophone picks up both acoustic and electric signals. However, we note that frequency mixing at the sum frequency only occurs when an acoustic field is applied. 

The difference frequency is unfortunately obscured by the DC coupler in the hydrophone which filters out low frequency signals, so we must depend upon looking at the sum frequencies.  

So a proof point is this, the mixing frequencies only appear on the hydrophone output, when there is an electric field and an acoustic field. 


So this is a second proofpoint that frequency mixing is occuring due to the acoustoelectric effect.
