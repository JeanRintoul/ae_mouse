t2 - F21 electrical attenuation. 
====================================================== 
Date: 09/10/2023
Note: I accidentally copied over the file 1 and file 16.
- RUN ae_calibrate_with_prf2.py. The amplitude at 500kHz is so huge, I don't think I need the preamp to do the 500kHz amplitude measurement. 

Note: I didn't calibrate the focus point, but simply stopped at a position where I could measure the PRF df, the carrier and the sum. 
All carrier measurements in volts. 

- - - F21 thicknesses. - - - 
Thin:1.3mm 
Medium:7mm
Thick:11.3mm
And no F21. So I should have 4 points on a line graph, each with 4 points each. 

DAQ range set to 4V on Ch 1. 

Keep DV and ML/AP coords the same for all measurements. 

1,2,3,4. NO F21. v@500khz          = 1.38,1.41,1.4,1.41   (volts)
   df = [45.79,121.59,17.35,190.76,216.07] (microvolts)
   sf = [1520,1634,1642,1700.98,311.33] (microvolts)   
5,6,7,8. F21 Thin: v@500khz        = 0.18, 0.19, 0.16, 0.16, 0.18 (volts)
   df = [143.95,187.98,195.8,131.5] (microvolts)
   sf = [369.24,284.68,252,345] (microvolts)   
9,10,11,12. F21 Medium: v@500khz   = 0.083, 0.07, 0.08, 0.08 (volts)
   df = [103,58.3,95.9,103] (microvolts)
   sf = [170,136,154,167] (microvolts)   
13,14,15,16 F21 Thick: v@500khz    = 0.06, 0.06, 0.066,  0.066   (volts) - this may just be the background level due to other stuffs.  
   df = [76,49,56,50] (microvolts)
   sf = [120,128,123,125] (microvolts)  Note: I accidentally copied over file 16, but I DID get the right measurements first... VBlah. Don't re-analyse file 16. 

TODO: plot of sum and difference frequency amplitudes changing with F21 thickness. 
The sum frequency seems to be giving me a more reliable amplitude metric. This may be due to my daq resolution and no. of averages... i have seen this before. 
The sum frequency is changing with the applied voltage - but is this due to electrical mixing or acoustoelectric mixing? 

The thick piece is too thick to use in practice.  

= = = = 

Calibrate the focus position without F21. Use the sum frequency as this appears more reliable. 

Do some measurements without F21, of a continuous wave, PRF wave, dual frequency wave such that the sum and difference frequencies are visible. All at 1MPa. (vout = 0.1V). Taken at the focus calibrated above. 
NOTE:(no preamp is used in these, as the no F21 amplitude is simply too high)
Duration all 4s. 
17,18,19,20 PRF 1020
21,22,23,24 continuous wave
25,26,27,28 dual frequency wave (df = 1000)
29,30,31,32 dual frequency wave (df = 10)

NOTE: NO PREAMP USED FOR THESE DAQ range = 2V. 

Place medium thick F21 at the focus, then proceed with spatial map. (after lunch)
Use the same preamp settings as I used in the previous PRF*PRF spatial plot. 
(I used gain = 100, preamp, no filters previously)

- electrodes are laying horizontal about 7mm apart. 
= = = = 

Spatial map using medium thickness F21. 
Concern: between then and now, my output transducer voltage is much higher. 

33. Without preamp. 1pm. much smaller. carrier at 0.09 volts. 

34. preamp gain = 100, PRF 1020. Same setting as before at focus. 
    With medium F21. I can still quite clearly see the mixing frequency dfx. 

35. What to do? Independent test which has amplitude applied the same as the PRF to see if mixing happens from an electric field only at these amplitudes? 

I took out the cable connecting to the transformer, and the amplitudes suddenly got MUCH bigger. It's as if the tx connector was providing GNDing. 

36. example calibration signal. It looks more linear... less deviant than previously... (compare with previously)

The question is - why do I have a baseline mixing here? Is this coming from a different source?
