The carrier frequency is key to obtaining good meps. 

Last time I found that the carrier frequency was key to getting a good response in the mouse. 

e127_rfti.py 
e127_prf_ti.py 
e127_transmission_spectrum.py 

It would be good to do a transmission spectrum using df = 1 for a variety of carrier frequencies in the mouse. 

- 
fg 1 is the electrode in gel on head with the hf prf signal. fg2 is the directly applied 1khz. 

Goals: 
1. Try direct stimulation using a high frequency, low prf field on one electrode, and a directly applied 1kHz field on the electrode going to the brain. Does it work? Yes/No. df = 1Hz. 
 If no, try direct RF TI. Does it work? Once I get it working go try direct stim again until I get a yes. 

2. NO  - transmission spectrum. To do this, I need to plug in a separate electrode measurement pair to ch 1 so that I can measure a signal somewhere. 

3. YES - Switch to US to apply the PRF signal. I may need to calibrate position using the prf code. Can I get a response? Yes, try a few different frequencies of PRF, if it works try to get video of a couple of dfs. 

- 4 could almost wait until after I have the transmission spectrum. 
4. YES - Switch to RF antenna to apply the PRF signal. 1kHz applied to brain the old fashioned way. Can I get a response? 

5. YES - transmission spectrum. 


=== start time: 10:49am === === 
- rfti test. 
- RF TI works at 1khz, 3V out of each. 
- e127_prf_ti, initially try with same amplitudes 3v each, it seems like just the 1khz effects it. 
- I am not sure how well the 500khz electrode is connected. 
- the prf method works when i move the carrier down to 5khz, i am not injecting much. 

- lets move to the rf amplifier to inject the high frequency signal, so I can go to larger amplitudes... 


- when I just inject the signal from the rf amplifier alone, at 500khz, the mouse does not respond. 
prf 500  = 279
prf 100  = smaller, biforcated. 
prf 1000 = mb looks like it was moving? 250

stop, there is steam coming from it. This is bad. Direct application of large volts at high frequencies is not a good idea...

transmission spectrum, mouse is waking. 10Hz is very clear. 

attempt of transmission spectrum before mouse wakes too much. 
Mouse is moving a ton at the lower frequencies. 

Direct stim: 
3v on each output. Stopped moving at 10kHz. 

Mouse into warming chamber at 1hr 15minutes. 

12:07am.

What results do I have? 
- I have single trial acoustoelectric neural recording I think. I should try to do it for VEPs, at a lower PRF. If it is electric mixing, I would guess the amplitude would be higher at a lower PRF. 
- I have ionic mixing in electrolytes. 

- voltage source version current source. 

- I have the dual ultrasound frequency thing. ? What even is that.
- I 'may' have mechanism of US neuromodulation. 

= = = 

acoustoelectric neural recording: 
- Electric mixing occurs between neurons and the electrical PRF? 
- The electrical PRF is induced via acoustoelectric mixing.
