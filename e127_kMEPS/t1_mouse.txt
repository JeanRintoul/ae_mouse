No need to connect the mouse, leave amplifier off as I plan to inject LARGE amplitudes. 

I have separated the mouse from ground by about 5cm, to try to increase the amplitude of the evoked response in the mouse. 

I can also try shielding the VEP electrode, such that the potential difference is larger. 

I can also try using a direct capacitively connected electrode. 

========  start time :    =====

i am not seeing anything with either pulsing or rf ti. 
I have moved to just a capacitive sheet... and still nothing. 

I could directly apply a voltage? Even when I do this... nothing is happening. 

I think this is a give away for  what the problem is... 

- switched to d bonos thing? 
- even at max amplitudes, directly applied... i get nothing. 
- absolutely 0. 

2 hrs. into warming chamber at 13:04. 

There is definitely something wrong with the way I am applying the electric field.
