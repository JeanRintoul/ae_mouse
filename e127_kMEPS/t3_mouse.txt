- I also need some code, which I do not have yet, where i pulse for at prf for a period of time then stop. 
later: work on dualfpulse_antenna.py to create a pulse once a second with a prf... 

Discovery that the carrier frequency must be 5kHz or below. The lower the better. 
This suggests that I should have a dual pulse. 

Start with direct application of voltage: 

Can I induce TI, at a based carrier frequency which is higher using duafti_antenna.py? 

Compare against regular TI responses. 

=== === === start time: 14:10 === === === 

rfti - vout =2, start of k, i can see motion of mouth. 

keeps having an error when i try dualfti_antenna... 

df is always 1 hz. 

prf = 500. The prf doesn't appear to be helping. 

- vout = 4, carrier = 10k, i see a response at 1hz df. 
- vout = 4, carrier = 100k, nothing. 
- vout = 4, carrier = 50k, nothing. 25mA goes through.  577 ohms. 
- vout = 4, carrier = 25k, nothing. 24mA goes through.  592 ohms. 
- vout = 4, carrier = 15k, nothing. 24mA goes through.  592 ohms. i can see it now. 

Try changing the PRF. carrier = 15k. The higher the PRF, the more current is measured. 
PRF 1000 - can see it. 
- prf = 100 , looks abit bigger. 
- prf = 2000, tiny response. 
- prf = 100, decent size response. 
- prf = 2000, tiny response. 

The prf does appear to matter... the lower the better. 

straight rf ti with 15k. vout = 4. 
- i can see it. 

rf ti with 25k, nothing. 
dualfrfti with 25k carrier, prf = 100. nothing. 
Basically - if my carrier goes above a f i see nothing. 

- rf ti with 20k carrier. nothing. 4v out. 
- rf ti with 20k carrier. nothing. 6v out. - i see it. 
looks like i can turn up the amplitude...to see at higher carrier fs. 

- dualfti, 20k, vout =6, prf = 100. big response. 
- dualfti, 20k, vout =6, prf = 50. big. 

is this prf = 50 result, larger than the direct ti at 20k carrier? no, not really. it appears the same or a bit smaller. 

- so we can do direct ti, and turn up the amplitude to get to higher carrier frequencies. 
- i see no advantage in the prf as previously thought. 
- 25k, 6v out, small response. 

- 50k carrier, 6V out. nothing. 
- 50k carrier, 12v out - i see it. 

- 

Can I apply two separate waveforms? This seems somewhat better than applying just the modulated one. 
Both directly applied, one with gel. 

- carrier = 5k, large amplitude response. pout = 0.05, vout = 2.0 
- carrier = 10k, pout = 0.05, vout = 2.0 - big response. 
- carrier = 25k, pout = 0.05, vout = 2.0 - nothing. 
- carrier = 25k, pout = 0.05, vout = 4.0 - small response - just nose. 
- carrier = 50k, pout = 0.05, vout = 4.0 - nothing. 
- carrier = 50k, pout = 0.1, vout = 8.0 -  see something
i am getting random movements 1hr 18 min. 
- carrier = 100k, pout = 0.1, vout = 8.0 - nothing
- carrier = 100k, pout = 0.2, vout = 8.0 - nothing. 

This works too, but similarly fades out as frequency increases. 
--- 

The way i am applying it, is to have the superposition happen in the function generator... 
if it is NOT a modulated wave.. is it different because it is mixing in the medium? 

- - 

- I am going to need a different stimulation strategy altogether. i.e. can I mix the US PRF at 1000, with a direct stimulating current at 1kHz? 

1 hr 26 min moved to warming chamber. 15:37. 


Synopsis: 
It seems that for the difference frequency to effect cells, the carrier needs to be low.

As frequency of source voltage increases, capacitive reactance decreases and current increases.

Xc = 1/ 

The equation for capacitance is inversely proportional to frequency. 

What is the equation for capacitive cell membrane wrt frequency? 




TODO: Applying two separate source sine waves directly, pulse one, and direct other one.
