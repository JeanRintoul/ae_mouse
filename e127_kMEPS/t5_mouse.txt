The carrier frequency is key to obtaining good electrical meps. However, this appears not to be true for ultrasound as I was able to get a response with two waves at 500khz df = 1 before. This makes the two methods DIFFERENT. So it is worth testing the ideas of mixing again both direct mixing and mixing through 1khz PRF. I can look at the signal on the voltage signal. 

Last time I found that the electrical carrier frequency was key to getting a good response in the mouse. 

e127_rfti.py 
e127_prf_ti.py 
e127_transmission_spectrum.py 

It would be good to do a transmission spectrum using df = 1 for a variety of carrier frequencies in the mouse.

Goals: 
1. calibrate position using e127_ae_calibrate_with_prf.py 
2. run e127_rfti.py with 500khz and 500khz +1 hz all acoustic, to see if I get motion at the envelope of 1Hz.  
3. If I can get motion at the envelope frequency, apply an electric field at high 499.999khz directly through brain, then apply continuous acoustic field. What does it look like? Can I see the difference frequency at all? Can I vary the levels to get a larger difference frequency? 
4. try direct electrical 1.001kHz with a PRF of 1khz through the 500khz ultrasound, to see if I can do mixing at the lower frequency. What is the amplitude of the difference frequency here? 


=== start time: 10:17am === === 
- white plug in the motor cortex.

- prf calibration failed really. 
- I am trying dual acoustic mep calibration at df = 400 now to calibrate position. 
- i think i need a high pass filter on the preamp to avoid dc stuff
- now try calibrating with the acoustoelectric effect, current going from MEP electrode to mouth vertically. df = 400 
- I am not picking anything up. 
- I am not seeing the acoustoelectric effect anywhere. 

- Mouse is starting to wake up. Whiskers are moving. 
- Right at the end i got a tail startle response. Not correlated with DF. 
- Altogether pretty underwhelming. 

1hr 31min. 
11:52am. 

- - - - I didn't get very far. 

TODO: I need to try and do the regular acoustoelectric effect in a petri dish.
TODO: check if the ISI code can work and go for the bare basics for acoustic meps. 
      with just pulse meps. - DONE. 

I left transducer set up for over weekend. 
I plugged in the acoustic chan into ch 1 to do the ISI work.

What results do I have? 
- I have single trial acoustoelectric neural recording I think. I should try to do it for VEPs, at a lower PRF. If it is electric mixing, I would guess the amplitude would be higher at a lower PRF. 
- I have ionic mixing in electrolytes. 

- voltage source version current source. 

- I have the dual ultrasound frequency thing. ? What even is that.
- I 'may' have mechanism of US neuromodulation. 

= = = 

acoustoelectric neural recording: 
- Electric mixing occurs between neurons and the electrical PRF? 
- The electrical PRF is induced via acoustoelectric mixing.
