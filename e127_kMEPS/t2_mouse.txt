Connect the mouse, with plan to do direct stimulation through electrodes, experimenting with GND location. 

IF... I get that working, then proceed to stimulating from a wire in gel on the head. 

Then, an antenna. 

=== start time: 10:35am === === === 

- directly connected, at start time of K, I am injecting 78mA, 23.5 V, 301 Ohm impedance and see nothing.

- perhaps the impedance is too low at the high frequencies. I decreased the frequency of stimulation to 100. Now I get a BIG movement. 
- My Fs is now 1e4. 
- I can now see a movement when I apply 2V!!! 
- 1V! 
- down to 3.7mA. 
- The dbono current source doesn't really work that well at low frequencies... 

Fs = 1e5. carrier = 2000 
- the lower the carrier here the better. I assume because impedance is higher? 
Lets try TI. 2khz and 2khz +2hz. Doesnt work at 1V. Works at 2V. 

This means, I could try with the antenna, but need a very low mixing frequency.... and pulses appear to work better. 
Didnt work at all. 

Amplitude with opposite amplitude electrodes, vs gnd in mouth. 

V out = 3 , carrier = 1000, pulse length = 0.1 I can see something GND is in mouth. 
i = 3.8ma 

Opposite polarity in mouth - giant movement at 3V. V out = 3 , carrier = 1000, pulse length = 0.1. GIANT RESPONSE. Thus GND is less effective than opposite polarity signal. 

Try with gel on head instead of the on top electrode... 
- it is working... current burst length = 0.01, 1V out. pulsing. 

Try capacitive coupling with silicon interface. Remember I have voltage in mouth not GND. 
- nada. NOTHING. Impedance reads super high. I think the current transmitted is still too low. 3.6mA. 
- lets try TI with the capacitive interface. 

Cap interface. 
- TI has a higher current, and lower impedance than anything else so far. But is less likely to stimulate than a pulse. This is going to be much lower amplitude though. 


--- 

- Go back to directly applied current through gel interface. As I would apply it in AE. 


Pulse: 
1500 big response. 
5000 response but smaller. 6mA is plenty. 
10khz small response. 
100khz. no response? 
double amplitude at 100khz. no response

bonos: 
- ti at 100khz  - response? 
- ti at 10khz = small response. 

electrode direct in gel, other in mouth. 

bigger response at df = 1 . 
vout = 4
df = 1
ti at 10khz  = legs move at 1hz. 8ma. 1.7kohm resistance, 15v pp
ti at 50khz  = nothing

10kh zti, df = 1... again works. Its not the current, this is lower current at 8.7mA...
it is the frequency. 

mouse is waking up. 


1hr 40 minutes. 

The current output doesn't matter past a certain frequency. I need to generate low frequencies. 

I am finding that I can only do TI to 10kHz - after that it doesn't work. 
The carrier frequency does matter. 
I also cannot do pulse stim at high frequencies - the carrier does matter. 

= = 

FOR RF TI, or Capacitive TI I could: 
- What I could do, is do a PRF signal at 1000Hz. Where the carrier is much higher? Then the secondary PRF frequency is the one of interest. 
- PRF TI, where I have two signals pulsing at some PRF that intersect at a lower frequency. 


= 1hr 45 minutes into warming chamvber 12:19 pm. 


- Learnings, the frequency that's applied completely changes the mouse response. everything works better at lower frequencies. 


TODO sometime:
- Both ae neuromod and the rf neuromod paper should have a plot of response wrt carrier frequency. 


- - - 

What might work is TI at 500Hz, directly coupled with the function generator instead so that I can use low frequencies through the capacitive interface.

= = = 

To do ae ti, position opposite polarity electrodes on head and in mouth. 

i think I could do it if I had a lower carrier frequency for the e field?
