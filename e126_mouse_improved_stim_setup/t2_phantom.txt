t2 - RF antenna with the RF amplifier test. Reps and jitter. 
The purpose of this test is to have a clean baseline for t1_mouse. 
All other settings are the same as t1. 
================================================== 

Preamp 10k low pass. Gain = 500. 

- both with jitter, reps. 
e126_pulse_antenna.py
e126_fswitching_antenna.py 

Do both the pulse protocol, and the frequency switching protocol. 
- gain = 500, 10k low pass filter. 

====== start time 12:41am ====== 


= Done, now set up for pulse with better noise arrangements i.e. cable not phantom = 
= = fridge off, faraday cage closed. = = 

1-50. pulse antenna.py 
51-100. fswitching protocol. i have turned off the ramp.
