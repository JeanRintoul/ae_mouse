t3 - RF antenna with the RF amplifier mouse test. Reps and jitter. Mouse with MEP electrode 2mm ML. 
================================================== 
Date of experiment: 21/11/2023  
Mouse Cage: 116345
Number of uses before: 9
Gender: male
Weight: 34.5g plus headbar. 
DOB: 6.05.2023

Isoflurane Anesthesia at 0.5. Donut RF Antenna.
Cable is positioned so it does not go alongside the mouse. 

Preamp 10k low pass. Gain = 500. 

- both with jitter, reps. 
e126_pulse_antenna.py
e126_fswitching_antenna.py 

   Do both the pulse protocol, and the frequency switching protocol. 
   - gain = 500, 10k low pass filter. 

try running it at 5MHz sample rate instead. 
only 3 channels are recording though. 

====== start time :    =====
fridge off, overhead light off, quiet environment. cable not touching mouse. 

cable is not touching body. 
Fs set to 5e6 i.e. 5MHz. 
iso = 0.75 

1-50. pulse. occasional small movements, otherwise motionless. 

51-100 fswitching iso =0.6. mouse moves a little once in a while. gain = 500. 
     i am seeing overloads on the preamp. 
     at file 70, switched to gain of 200 to stop ovlds. 

== consider a set with high anesthesia for pulse switching  ==  

101-140 iso = 1.5 pulse switch. gain = 500. 

=== 1hr 8 mins under iso.
