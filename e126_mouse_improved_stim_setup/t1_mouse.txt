t3 - RF antenna with the RF amplifier mouse test. Reps and jitter. Mouse with MEP electrode 2mm ML. 
================================================== 
Date of experiment: 21/11/2023  
Mouse Cage: 116345
Number of uses before: 1
Gender: male
Weight: 34.5g plus headbar. 
DOB: 6.05.2023

Isoflurane Anesthesia at 0.5. Donut RF Antenna.
Cable is positioned so it does not go alongside the mouse. 

Preamp 10k low pass. Gain = 500. 

- both with jitter, reps.

1. Do mouse impedance spectrum with frequency. 
2. Switch to 1e7 code, turning off the extra channels in the code. 
   Make sure cable is connected such that it goes straight back, not next to body. 
   Iso = 0.5. Run the fswitching background signal for longer(no ramp), to avoid the issue I currently have. 

   Do both the pulse protocol, and the frequency switching protocol. 

   - gain = 500, 10k low pass filter. 

====== start time 10:57am ====== 

Impedance spectrum: 
1-2. 10hz - 
3-4. 1000Hz - i got movement. 3v out. 
5-6. 10khz  - 1 vout 
7-8 100khz  - 
9-10 500kHz -
11-12 1Mhz -
13-14 1.5MHz -
15-16 2MHz - 

= Done, now set up for pulse with better noise arrangements i.e. cable not near mouse = 
= = fridge off, overhead lights off, faraday cage closed. = = 

vout = 0.8, iso = 0.75 , very occasional very small movements. Overall mouse was pretty still. 

17-67. pulse antenna.py 

iso = 0.75 
68-118. fswitching protocol. i have turned off the ramp. 

==== should I go for one set of measurements with higher iso? ==== i.e. 1.5? 
fswitching protocol? 
119-159. fswitching at iso = 1.5 


== END time under iso = 1 hr 33 minutes  ==
