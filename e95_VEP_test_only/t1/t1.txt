The right eye has cement pretty close to it. I suspect the right eye is damaged in some way. This mouse has too much cement and had trouble fitting into neurotar. 

This mouse has been used in 2 experiments. Mostly the motor cortex ones. 

This experiment I could: 
- see if I can obtain VEPs?

- also the MEP electrode is over the vibrissa. Hence, any stimulus info is not directly applicable. 

Lets do an inventory of my mice.

1. There is a mouse that has done 9 experiments. I may be able to add a screw and turn it into a MEP mouse? Either that - or retire the mouse. TBD. 

2. There is a mouse that sort of appears to leak fluid. Maybe I can use this mouse instead for ephys? Retire this mouse.

3. I have a new mouse, which is an unknown quantity. 

4. I have this mouse, which looks like the area above its eye may be damaged. Lets test it. It is only good for this purpose, possibly.

11:23 start VEP testing with this mouse, which may be blind in right eye. 

1. test with preamp at 1000 gain. I can see what looks like signal, but it seems to peak around 2.8Hz, nothing is at 7Hz LED frequency. 

2. test plugging into the differential input of the daq ch 4 instead. still 2.75Hz seems to be predominant. 

3. change led frequency down to 7, or 3.5 repeats per second. 

4. move back to preamp. gain 100. I see what looks like a neural signal, but not one at the LED frequency. 

5. gain 100. I still cannot see VEPs. 

6. led frequency = 10. should result on 5 ons per second. I am seeing a neural signal I think, but not VEP. 

7. 5hz really unconvincing. I think the preamp is working. I think I am seeing the anaesthesia oscillation from ketamine/xylazine. 

8. change filter cutoff 3.5-300hz to see the 5hz more clearly. 

9. switch to other side. Right eye still works. 

10. I think I see large amplitude oscillations due to the anesthesia, but not so much VEPs. Recover the mouse, decide later what to do with it. 

I think this mouse is blind in the left eye. The MEP electrode is at vibrissa. The head bar is crooked and has too much cement.
