VEP test with saline. 
======

I have a noise problem. 
Run the ae_demod_vep.py in saline solution. 
Try to get rid of the mains harmonic noise. 

I think I need to inject a signal to ensure it is amplifying. 

1. 
gain 1, 0.04v raw peak, 100 microvolts. can't really see it due to noise. 
gain 10, 0.047v raw peak 100 microvolt 70hz. 
gain 100, 0.15 raw peak 100 microvolts, getting clearer.. noise falling away. 
gain 500, 0.8v peak to peak, looks very good. 

I changed the adc range down to 2v p-p. 

When preamp is plugged into mains, the size of the raw measured signal is larger. i.e. 0.8v peak. 
Whereas when it isn't plugged into mains, I see a peak of 0.25. Hence... use the preamp without it being plugged into mains.  

I changed the measurement cables as well so they are shorter. 

14 microvolt 100 hz when preamp not plugged in. similar when it is plugged in.
