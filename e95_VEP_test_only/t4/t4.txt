VEP test with ket/xyl and MEP test on new mouse. 
======

- new mouse. cag number: 112289 
this mouse has mep coords AP 0.0, ML 2.0mm.

3.2 ket
1.5xyl
6.8 antisedan
reup dose: 1 tick ket

This mouse fits into neurotar well. Looks good so far. 
Using MEP screw as VEP reference. 

ae_demod_vep.py 
can I see a VEP? Decide here whether to try demodulation or not. 

ae_calibrate_with_ae.py 
 - I will have to calibrate the MEP position. This will take time. 

ae_test.py - can I see a MEP? 

- i could do VEPs and just e stim to see if I have the right spot? 

= = 

13:30 start. gain 500 throughout. 

1. 500 gain. I can see it - it is very small. 1 microvolt. 

2. I can see it, very small. I can also see the k oscillations

3-10. Neural signal with 7 hz. 

Attach MEP electrodes. Try a low amplitude MEP on right forepaw with just e stim. 

Reverse the MEP electrodes and locate the demod location. calibrate with a low voltage. 

repeat VEP experiment, this time with US. 

leave air gap, get a set of 10. 

11. MEP electroddes read to stim forepaw. 
   running ae_calibrate with ae.py 
   v out = 3v out I can see paw movement. 

12. 2v out. I see nothing. 

13. Swap the electrodes around ready for ae calibration for VEPs. 

I see a big movement. mouse is waking. no time to calibrate. 
administer antisedan. 
1hr 8 minutes. Into warming chamber. 

The VEP wire came off. Next time I will have to replace it. But this mouse had both VEPs and paw movement. The headbar was well positioned. 

= = 

Is it possible some of my other mice have broken VEP wires? 

I think the reason I haven't been able to do demod yet with the 500khz transducer, is due to positioning calibration. The smaller transducer was easier to calibrate, but didn't pass the noise test.
