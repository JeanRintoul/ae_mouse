VEP test with isoflurane. 
======
Ephys mouse with ulcerative dermatitis. This was a great mouse. Notably - the headbar is positioned further away from its eyes. Fits easily in headbar.

- there is no way i can see where bregma is. The reference that was - is covered in dental cement. 

- this mouse has reference back rostral of lambda. 

= = 

I connected the Reference to GND. The VEP wire is connected. 
I placed a silver wire in some saline inside the head bar moat...

I seem to get a weird level jumping a lot of the time. 

1-10. 7hz. I can see it mb, not super clear. gain 100 

This mouse, without a usable reference - but using a saline puddle - gave the best VEP of the day. 
1hr end.
