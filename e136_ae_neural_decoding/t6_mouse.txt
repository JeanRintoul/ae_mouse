t3 - acoustoelectric neural recording 4Hz, attempt at repeat. 
=================================================================

4Hz, just try to repeat last weeks successful AE result. Is it repeatable? 
Try to do a two tone test as well.

Notably - this good mouse has nailpolish on the electrodes... 
TOOD: Add nail polish to electrodes in new mice. 

- ensure that the two electrodes are not electrically connected via the gel. 
- calibrate position, using the VEP electrode as the current source, and two external to head references. 
- Perform F21, Kaiser windowed, and SNR averaged acoustoelectric neural recording. 
  Do LOTS of repeats.  
Then in post processing, I can ideally mess around with matched filters to see what I can come up with. For instance, using a better more accurate template for the 4Hz VEP would be good. 
- Preamp 1M low pass, 0.3Hz high pass. F21 in place. 
- remember to do depth calibration. 

If I get AE neural recording today, then make another mouse on monday? 

= = = = = = Start time: 11:17am = = = = = =  

- First do some 4Hz VEPs. Gain = 500, no filters on preamp. Do I see anything? 
- It's a great size vep. 40 microvolts. 

- When I set up the US, first arrange the wires ready for both two tone test, and calibration. 
- Remember to also do depth calibration.  Done, my biggest magnitude was 6.26 microvolts. The depth calibration helped a lot. 
- This amplitude is still small. 
- I then re-pluggeed the cables ready for the main ae neural recording series. 
- 1 hr in. run e136_ae_neural_recording.py 
- p out = 0.14, same settings as that last recording last friday. 

- I need to double check if time syncing is working? 
- I have a really low amplitude for the electric signal coming from the US this time. It's there, but small... 

10 recordings in, I didn't get it -10.62, -6.69 
20 recordings in, -4.96
30 recordings in, -15? 
40 recordings in, 
stop at 40? it isn't there. 

I gave it another tick of ket at 1 hr 36 mins
try some without the f21? 

Also the US amplitude at 500kHz is REALLY low? Something is wrong with the US. Maybe there is air in it? need to put new water in it?  

Something is weird with the US electrical thing. 

Mouse is waking. 
2 hrs 10 min into warming chamber.
