- ensure that the two electrodes are not electrically connected via the gel. 
- calibrate position, using the VEP electrode as the current source, and two external to head references. 
- Perform F21, Kaiser windowed, and SNR averaged acoustoelectric neural recording. 
  Do LOTS of repeats.  
Then in post processing, I can ideally mess around with matched filters to see what I can come up with. For instance, using a better more accurate template for the 4Hz VEP would be good. 
- Preamp 1M low pass, 0.3Hz high pass. F21 in place.

Spike demod. preamp 500 gain. 12 sec duration. Fs = 100kHz. 
This is the mouse with the vertical implant. 
I think I got nice VEPs on this instance, as I could see them in a single recording. 

1. Position calibrate with F21 in place. 
I messed up putting the electrodes in at the right time. 
My calibration was rough. 
my max value was only 8.7... so not great. Maybe this was due to other things though like the measurement electrode position?

2. Do lots of repeats using a 4Hz LED waveform. 8Hz peak in FFT. 
   preamp 0.3-1MHz band pass. 
   I am now running 8 second duration recordings. pout = 0.14v. 
   Fs = 5MHz. Started this 40 minutes in, after spike demod recordings and position calibration. 
   It is looking like I got it. I am seeing sneak peaks every 10 recordings. 

   I'm getting an add of about 2SNR every 10 recordings?
   At 50 recordings I get an SNR of 39.2
   28.28, 35.18, 36.4, 38.5, 39.2

Into warming chamber at 3pm. 1:44hrs under ketamine. 
Administered saline, made wet mash for recovery. 

Thank you most excellent 9 month old mouse!

Looking at this - I DID get it. 
I didn't do any artefact tests however. I think this needs a two-tone test. 

Also, it'd be good to do it at a slightly higher frequency. There is a lot of gunk around the 500kHz. 

Also, now I look back at the data - the signal was railing. This suggests that it is indeed an artefact?
