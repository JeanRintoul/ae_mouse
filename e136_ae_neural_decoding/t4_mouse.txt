t4 - acoustoelectric neural recording with low-dose ketamine. 
=================================================================

Last test, I got acoustoelectric neural recording- with a different mouse. 
This mouse had NO VEPS last week. I would like to find out if it has VEPS on a very low dose of ketamine, to determine if drug dosage is the key here. 

IF the mouse DOES become anesthetized, then go forward with spike demodulation as well as testing of acoustoelectric neural recording. 

This mouse has NO VEP again, using a ketamine half dose. 

Ket/Xyl
drugs:
antidote: 5.0
X: 0.6
k1: 1.2
k2: 1.0
saline: 50

Date of experiment: 02/02/2024  
Mouse Cage: 125962
Number of uses before: 1
Gender: male
Weight: 26.4g including headbar.

- ensure that the two electrodes are not electrically connected via the gel. 
- calibrate position, using the VEP electrode as the current source, and two external to head references. 
- Perform F21, Kaiser windowed, and SNR averaged acoustoelectric neural recording. 
  Do LOTS of repeats.  
Then in post processing, I can ideally mess around with matched filters to see what I can come up with. For instance, using a better more accurate template for the 4Hz VEP would be good. 
- Preamp 1M low pass, 0.3Hz high pass. F21 in place.

Sub cut injection at 2minutes. Taking more time to kick in. Mouse momentarily awake at 4 minutes. 

Spike demod. preamp 500 gain. 12 sec duration. Fs = 100kHz. 
This is the mouse with the diagnoal implant. 
- ketamine had a big 2.5Hz peak. 

- this mouse has NO VEP. 
Stop experiment. There is no point to try acoustoelectric neural recording if I cannot get a signal. 
- This mouse has now died. 
Maybe I should have tried pressing on the electrodes in case they had become dislodged?

I need a new mouse. Prepare for surgery.
