t2 - acoustoelectric neural recording limitations in phantom. 
=================================================================

- ensure that the two electrodes are not electrically connected via the gel. 

- calibrate position, using the VEP electrode as the current source, and two external to head references. 
- Perform F21, Kaiser windowed, and SNR averaged acoustoelectric neural recording. 


F21 in place, Gain = 1000, 0.3Hz high pass on preamp, Duration = 12. Fs = 5e6.

- F21 in place. 
- First thing I notice is that my amplitudes are larger in the saline than they were in the mouse. This could be because my measurement electrode is MUCH closer to the current source. Tested true. I think i am calibrating position OK. 

folder: 
- 15 recordings of 8Hz at 100 microvolts. 
- gain = 200.  Note: on analysis I could NOT recover the signal. 

- Day 2: 
I implement a low pass filter on the preamp 1MHz, to remove hf noise and lower the noise floor. 
- 40 microvolts, I can see it after 10 recordings. SNR 7.54 without use of matched filter. 
- I do definitely need a LOT more recordings. 
- I think based on this it is reasonable to move to 8 second recordings as they are so large. This means I should adjust my LED to match this well.
