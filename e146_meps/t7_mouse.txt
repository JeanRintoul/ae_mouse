t7 - mouse 
======================================================================================

- Continuous wave loo test, showing that adding an additional electric field, changes the EMG response. Have both fields at the same frequency. 

- Try some AE Loo tests at higher amplitudes? How do I maximize the DC offset? It 'may' be that a faster or slower frequency is key - try to generate a 10mV oscillation. 

- EMG in the front paw.

- emg in tail and rear paw. 

= = = = = = = start time: 9:50 am = = = = = = = 
- all set up 17 minutes in. 
- Ok I am generating a beautiful 0.5Hz, but it may be too early for EMG. 
- the mouse feels a bit cold - i wonder if this is a problem. 

- when I put the volts up past 0.1, i seem to get too much residual in the emg signal. 
- I moved the cables so the cable from the sr560 wasnt near the stim cable. 

- at pout - 0.2, v 0.1 i am way under motor threshold. 

Problem: When I put the voltage up, the EMG signal is a mess. 

- I still have a gnding issue... 
- put moisture in mouth too. 
- moisture on belly. 

- TO measure EMG, I am going to have to go down to a lower amplitude voltage - OR move the other electrode to the same leg to make a small difference? 

- The second emg electrode had slipped out abit... i need a more secure solution to this. 

- I am having a lot of issue with the emg electrodes. I am getting noise from the voltage source on them. 

- Over time, the pressure induced dc does appear to go down. I am still not getting any paw response at 1hr 35 minutes. Despite pressure being quite high.  

- Why is this mouse completely unresponsive so late in the piece? The signal I am applying looks really good. 
1hr 43 i see a whisker twitch! 

- mouse is suddnely pretty awake 2 minutes later? 
very responsive. 

Weirdly, my noise issue subsided as the mouse was waking? 2hrs in now. 

Look at: 
- with aedc6, the mouse had lots of moving under the ae field, no moving under the pressure field, or v field... 
- can i repeat this? mouse started moving too much. stop. 

mouse into warming chamber 2hr 14 minutesin. 12:03


Though visually aedc6 was awesome... i couldnt get it due to the voltage signal somehow being in the wrong f range? 

- when there was emg signal... i DID get it. So that isn't the problem. Why amn I not filtering away the EMG? 
- It looks like the RF amplifier is injecting mains noise into the system? 

This is with the RF amplifier.
