t8 - mouse 
======================================================================================

This time I have moved the EMG SR560 to where the other one is, ideally isolating it from the second RF amplifier. 

EMG in rear paw. 
Try fswitch test. 

Attempt: 
AEDC loo test
AE loo test
Fswitch loo test

- 18 minutes fully set up. 

It has EMG? at current amplitude 0.1, p0.2. 

It is getting stim just from the voltage. I put volts down to 0.05. 
I have a vast EMG improvement.
- It just seems like the voltage is injecting an emg signal... 

- So the voltage is still injecting noise... 
- I am refining fswitch to be pretty good. 
- I added gnding to the mouse just now, to try to decrease the voltage noise on the EMG when I apply this field. 
- Let's change the filtering on the preamp for EMG? ovlded, keep the 30hz high pass. 
- Adding or removing the GND under mouse appears to do nothing. 

1hr 11minutes. mouse is waking up. 

- There is clear noise from the voltage source on the EMG. Perhaps I will need to live with it? I should do some analysis about what it is exactly... 

1hr 27 minutes, mouse is too awake. 


switch4 - i unplugged the gnd line from the tx. there were ovlds. 
i put gain down to 200. there are still ovlds. gnd plugged in again 


It is possible there is an issue with the EMG cables? or electrodes... looks like one might have fallen out at the end. the one in the tail. 

The switch test 'might' have worked, i saw twitches but not sure of timing, need to analyse. The EMG electrodes are an issue though. 

This mouse had a huge offset when US was applied. 

Results: I am switching the EMG cables.
