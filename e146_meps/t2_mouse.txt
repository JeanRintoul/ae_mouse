t2 - ae meps, with new rf amplifier and bono tx to deliver electric field.  
======================================================================================

Goal: Can I see EMG or movement when I apply acoustoelectric neuromodulation under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia. 

- I have new F21
- I will have two electrodes in the tail or tail and leg to measure EMG without heart rate.  
- preamp filter try 1k low pass only
- lp hardware filter is in place.

- reapplication of silicon at 13 minutes in. 

I tried ae mep, and pulsing e field with cont p field. 
I am seeing the original pulse signal in the EMG, but NOT muscle movement. 

I am seeing just the noise I am making in the EMG... I could turn up the gain. 
Otherwise I need to reorg equipment. 

I am getting a weird psike at the beginning right now. 

Try a loo test of each type of waveform. 


I am not seeing EMG. I cannot turn the gain up past 500 due to noise. 

My computer suddenly shut down when running these. I think this may be due to improper grounding of the mouse. 

I added mouse grounding. Gain = 500. 

I change the preamp filter cut offs to 30Hz0>1k, gain = 500. Seems to be ok. 

1hr 20, mouse whiskers moved when stim applied. 

Mouse is good to go now. 

I repeat the loo test at high v, and i see movement more to do with the pressure than the 0.5hz generated. 

I keep putting the voltage up on each loo test. at v =0.2 it is 90V pp. 
vout 0.25 is 117 PP. 

Big response at 0.25, hard to see direct EMG correlation but MAYBE? 

I videoed just the 0.3V output one. 

NOTE: EMG preamp is 30hz-1k band pass. So I definitely see a larger muscle response when i apply both fields... I am somehow not getting a great periodic reflection of what I am doing though. Perhaps the US focus isn't great? Unclear. 

Finally ae p out 0.1, vout 0.3

Finish, analyze, and wait for mouse to entirely recover. 

Into warming chamber 1hr 53 mintues. 

At no point did I see clean paw movements
