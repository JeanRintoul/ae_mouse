t3 - mouse 
======================================================================================

Goal: Using a longer duration dual field waveform, can I see the difference frequency? 
Can I also try the difference delta strategy to elicit EMG spikes. 

Hardware improvements: 
In t2 I had large 50hz noise on the SR560. This time, I have shielded the filter that goes into the SR560 with glad wrap and aluminium foil, and am running the SR560 for EMG off battery to isolate from mains. 

Hardware set up notes: 
RF amplifier with Bono TX. Two SR560s for EMG and brain measurements. 

Note: I think the EMG shows there is a low frequency component due to the voltage source. This is less focal though.

- at 2MHz function generator I have a weird aliasing effect. 
I am getting a large DC offset. I can see this in the EMG. 
Is the DC offset coming from the pressure or the voltage field? 
The voltage field... 

So the voltage field alone, or the pressure field can cause a DC offset... 
I need to find a place where I can escape this. 

When I have a large DC offset, just the voltage causes EMG. 

Discovery, there is a DC offset which can occur due to charge imbalance when applying an electric field. 

I can also get a DC offset when I apply the pressure field... when it mixes with the e field there.  

- 
- When I have a DC offset from the applied field, I generate 'amplitude' in the EMG. 
- This is what i want to avoid really. 

Why is there a big DC offset between the tail and leg, and not between the brain electrodes? 


1. long mep, 12 seconds, p out 0.1, 

- ae loo test 1: brain gain = 10, emg_gain = 500 with 30-1k band pass. p=0.18,v=0.06.
- ae loo test 2: brain gain = 10, emg_gain = 500 with 30-1k band pass. p=0.18,v=0.1. - got a whisker movement. 
1hr 7 minutes, mouse can move. 
- ae loo test 3: p=0.18,v=0.05

- ae loo test 3: p=0.1,v=0.05

- I got a depression at the start of pressure. 

- The emg seems time lagged, and based on a shape change. What is EMG based on - a threshold? 

Finish at 11:06am - moved to chamber. 1:37

Result:
- there is a big DC offset across the EMG electrodes... what if i placed the EMG electrodes closer together? This should reduce the DC. 

In all of these, gain brain = 10, gain emg = 500 with a 40-1Mhz filter. 
I seem to have really big DC offsets when I apply voltage today.
