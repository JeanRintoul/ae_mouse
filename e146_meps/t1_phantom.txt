When I apply a current, I am getting a large DC offset. This DC offset decreases, when I add a GND. 
So, I need to add a GND to my mouse. 

Oh shit, one electrode causes electrolysis in the liquid... that is why you neeed biphasic.     
No this doesnt explain what I see on the measurement electrodes? Or does it? 
removing the monitor didnt change anything. 

What I could do.. is use another PtIr electrode for the gnd? oh wait it halved the size of this. 

for tomorrow: 
- the solution would be to use this and a biphasic tx? 


- Create a recording which shows the DC offset issue with and without a biphasic current source. 

RF amplifier characterization. 2 PtIr electrodes. i have lp filter in place on the recording side. 
preamp filter 0.3-1Mhz. 
12second recording, gain = 1, 28V pp. (vout = 0.1), 500 uv dc shifts at start and end. 

I see giant DC sweeps... 50000 uv. 

= = 
- putting bonos tx in front of it. THE DC HAS GONE? EVEN though i am applying 54Vpp. 

= I have saved two files which exemplify the difference. 

Having a biphasic voltage is key.
