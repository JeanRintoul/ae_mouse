t6 - mouse 
======================================================================================

- Continuous wave loo test, showing that adding an additional electric field, changes the EMG response. Have both fields at the same frequency. 

- Try some AE Loo tests at higher amplitudes? How do I maximize the DC offset? It 'may' be that a faster or slower frequency is key - try to generate a 10mV oscillation. 

- EMG in the front paw.

- I am not seeing any EMG. This mouse seems less responsive? 
  Mouse seems genuinely 'off' while under anesthesia. 

The light is going on and off - I think i ened better GNDing. 

I added better gnding, but light still go on and off... 

- mouse small movement at 1hr 4 minutes. 

Changing the polarity of the stim field made the voltage amplitude sky rocket? Changing the polarity of the electrodes has a massive effect? 

Suddenly mouse is overly responsive. 

1hr 18min. 
I seem to be getting some noise interference in the emg measurement, maybe because I had stim cables near it? 


My EMG is crazy.. i think i had a dc. 

I have some weird grounding issue.. all the files are shite. STOP. it is 1hr 40 minutes anyway. 

14:40 into warming chamber. 1hr 45mins. 

I think one of the EMG electrodes had come out, AND I wasn't getting super clear EMG anyway. 

In two of the 12 second files... at 0.5dF it looks like I might be getting some EMG. The EMG looks so weird that I am not sure. 

That, and the light goiung on and off suggest I had a grounding disaster this time. Write off this experiment.
