t4 - mouse 
======================================================================================

Goal: US modulation decreases in amplitude when the electric signal from the ultrasound is blocked. 
US modulation increases in amplitude when an independent electric field is added. 


Hardware improvements: 
- try 2 EMG electrodes in a single paw to try to decrease DC offset between measurement points. 

1. At the start do ae_pulse_mep where I keep the acoustic amplitude stable, and pulse the e field. 
2. With and without F21 measurements. At the end when mouse has movements. e146_us_pulse_mep.py

- Start with no F21 in place? 

gain in brain = 10, gain in EMG = 500. 
- lootest4 I had overload - whereby i may have been inducing frequency mixing with itself? 

- i can confirm that the peaks at start and end pulse are not EMG. 

- i fiddled with the pulse start times for test 6. improved. 
- I am NOT seeing EMG. 

- could the whole low frequency signal be seen as rectification from my filter???

stop, put one electrode in tail. Still, no EMG. This suggests that the mouse simply isnt responding yet. So that means I could put the electrode back in the leg, as I do not yet have a clear answer on it? 

- I am now getting EMG. 1hr 19 minutes in. at p = 0.3 

I would say EMG was LESS sensitive this time... 
sometimes not picking up small movements, whereas it appeared to do a better job when it was in the tail. 

For the pulse mep, I seem to only get a response for the first one, which coincides with the US onset - which is a HUGE DC offset about 3000 uV in size. 

1hr 40 mins moved into warming chamber. 

Result: 
This mouse didn't get EMG until close to the end. 
- I got a single good F21 recording (3 pulses). This should make a the picture I want... I should consider carefully what next to do. 

- the pulse series is confounded by the start of the pressure being when the 

Discovery: I have been filtering the EMG wrong... I should not be high pass filtering it... it causes giant filter artefacts.
