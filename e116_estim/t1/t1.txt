For RF TI settings were previously: 
Gain = 500 before. 
df    = 1,2,3,4,5,10,40,100. 
1k low pass filter. 


Get additional 5k low pass filter and associated cables ready too. 

============================================ 

Goal: Apply pulse e stim and sine wave stimulation. Observe the peaks and lfp. 
I could try direct sine wave without a preamp, hoping the directness to neurons will help me see it - i.e. on the same ch I apply voltage. 
If I apply a high frequency pulse, at a certain interval, I should be able to see the LFP and spikes. It is possible I cannot have high gain. I would have to test this.

UNfortuantely I had no impedance adapter connected here... next time. 

1. daq range 0.8. two 30ms pulses. Unclear. I think my noise floor is too high. 
   Need to switch to preamp or apply a larger voltage. V = 0.2 

2. Larger voltage 0.5 

3. v out = 2 daq range = 2 

4. switched to mouth gnd cup electrode. Nothing. I think I need the preamp. 
That means I need a different stim and measurement system. 
Measurement are the two implanted electrodes. 
Stim will be 1 cup electrode in mouth, one stim in gel on head. 
Added 5k low pass filter. 
Fs = 5e6
carrier = 500000
gain = 1 
vout = 0.5

5. gain = 100, vout = 1, now I can clearly see the ketamine waveform, but not spikes. 
   higher voltage? 

6. gain = 100, vout = 4, now I think I see something. 

7. gain = 100, vout = 4, 

8. gain = 100, vout = 6, i think i am just seeing the filter artefacts and am not actually seeing the neural signal. That means the voltage is there, but neural signal leaves something to be desired. Maybe there is a tiny something there? 

9. increase gain to 200. 

10. add preamp low pass filter with cutoff 10k. gain = 200. vout = 6 

11. gain = 500, all other settings the same. still have 5k low pass filter there. 

12. gain = 1000, 

13. gain = 1000. vout = 8, nothing

14. gain = 1000. vout = 12, nothing

15. change frequency to 1hz. vout = 8 

16. repeat

17. repeat. It looks like a rough pattern at 1hz, but this may be the delta waveform. 

18. 2hz. vout = 8v

19. vout = 12v. v large amplitude. 

20. vout = 8v. 
It is not worth testing sine wave, or moving to RF ti unless the electrode placed in gel can have an effect. 

21. vout = 10. I can finally see a LFP. Just one though. It is possible the mouse is unresponsive due to K. Also, whiskers have started moving by themselves.... 

22. LFPs.... 

23. vout = 8, prf = 1. I saw some movements... this time. 

24. switch to no ramp

25. vout = 10 .There is a clear response when the DAQ starts and stops.. but otherwise no. 

26. prf = 2, vout = 8, interesting check out... its as if there is a delay. 

27. I saw movement, prf = 2, vout = 8 at about 2hz. 

28. headbar fell off... had to kill the mouse. 

= = = end = = = 

I got a few LFPs, but it isn't very convincing. 
I think it would be worth concentrating on this experiment, until I optimize this. 
Move to Isoflurane at low amplitudes perhaps. 
The ketamine waveform is so huge, the LFPs are so small.
