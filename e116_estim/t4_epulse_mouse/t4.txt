PRF direct stim test. 
- PRF = 2, Iso = 0.5. 
- Vary the burst length and amplitude only. 
- Burst lengths - 200 microseconds, 1 ms, 50ms, 100ms. 

= = = 10:54am. = = = 
cup electrode gnd on tail. 
I am holding the wire stim on the stereotax for stability. 

prf = 2 (once every 2 seconds)
iso = 0.8 

I can see the 2Hz in the fft. vout = 1. 

1-5. 200 microseconds. gain = 100, filter hp, 0.3, lp 10k. 
The mouse visibly moves when field is applied. But not every time. 

iso = 0.6 

6-10. 1ms pulse length. I can see a pretty clear 4Hz in these. 

Mouse moved - up the iso to 1.0 
11-15. 50ms. - I can see this more clearly in the raw data. I do not know if it is the mouse, or it is the applied signal though. 
11. iso was at 0.6
12 iso was at 1.0 
13. iso at 1.0 
14. iso back to 0.75
15. 

16-20 0.1s(100ms) iso 0.75  - i can easily see sub harmoncis. 
18 iso down to 0.6 
19 iso 0.6 
20 iso 0.6 

iso = 0.6 
21-25 0.01s(10ms) - is see a sharp 4Hz, and no subharmonics... by eye and before analysis, this seems like a good pulse duration. 


Finish with a low frequency to try to see movement. i.e. prf =0.5 (once every 2 seconds)
below is prf = 0.5, 10ms pulse duration. 
26. prf = 0.5, pulse length = 0.01s - mouse woke up analyse this one. iso =0.6 after long period. 
27. iso = 1. 
28. iso = 0.75, put more conductive gel over electrode. 
29. iso = 0.75 signal gets bigger. 
30. iso = 0.75 
31. iso = 0.75 mouse awake. 
32. iso = 0.75 mouse not moving. 
33. 
34.
35.
end of prf = 0.5 series. 

Gain was always 100, Fs = 5e6. i had the same filter all the time. 0.3Hz. 
Turn off preamp. Increase the voltage. Can I see a movement? 

36. No - I think I have something else wrong right now, which is limiting whether I get a movement. 

Try placing the GND under the chest? Nothing. 
Try a sine wave? still no movement. 
I put iso to 0 - still no movement. 
Ok - I have a problem with my behavioral test. 
I think maybe motor cortex electrode placement. 

1hr 18 minutes moved to warming chamber. 

Find out: 
It is possible the gel is meaning the current dissipates over the head bar. 

TODO: processing step, remove the stim area, then do the filtering. 

I have a problem with my behavioral test... even with e-stim... Is it electrode placement? 

Read about using a sciatic nerve to do behavioral test?
