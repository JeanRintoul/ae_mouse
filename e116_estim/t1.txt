Code to run: pulse e stim. Need to exp with gain settings.

Gender: male
Goal: Apply pulse e stim and sine wave stimulation. Observe the peaks and lfp. 
I could try direct sine wave without a preamp, hoping the directness to neurons will help me see it - i.e. on the same ch I apply voltage. 
If I apply a high frequency pulse, at a certain interval, I should be able to see the LFP and spikes. It is possible I cannot have high gain. I would have to test this.

Number of uses before: 0, surgery 1.5 weeks previous. 
Problem: If I apply direct sine waves, I cannot have a high enough gain on my amplifier to see anything.
