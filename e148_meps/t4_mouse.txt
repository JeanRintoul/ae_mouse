- pulse test with and without F21. 
- acoustically connected and disconnected test. 
- no filter on the brain preamp at all. gain = 200. 
- EMG preamp 100Hz-1kHz filter, gain = 500. 
- F21 test: start with no F21 - when I get an EMG response add the F21 and add 20% to the pressure, and repeat a few times.
