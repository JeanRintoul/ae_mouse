Acoustoelectric neural recording test next - Ketamine: 

- do some VEP recordings without the US turned on. Is the signal still modulated? 

- How to calibrate the US position? PRF wasn't working. I could apply a field at a high frequency? 
- Also try with a 10Hz sine wave applied artificial signal in mouse - can I demodulate it? 
- Try for PRF 40, 80, PRF 120, PRF 240, PRF 520, 1020. 
- 1Hz LED VEP for largest amplitude, and 10Hz for greatest reconstruction accuracy? 

- Add a control signal to show the mixing is not occuring in the preamp, and only occurs when I apply an acoustic signal in the mouse, before I do other recordings. i.e. apply an electric signal at the VEP amplitude, and the PRF amplitude as well. i.e. a 500kHz current signal, pulsed at the PRF, and a simulated signal. 

========  start time : 10:14am   ======= 
Fs = 5Mhz, once a second LED. Gain = 500, no preamp filters. 

Calibrate - mouth electrode and 

Do the twotone test at the end, after I know what amplitude electrical signals to inject. 
For the twotone test. 
- e132_ae_twotone_test.py 
- Apply the PRF current signal via the mouth electrode and one positioned over top of the head with gel. Apply the simulated brain signal also with an electrode in the gel. 
- measure with the regular electrodes keeping the gain the same? 

====

1. VEP recordings 1Hz and 10hz. Gain = 500, no filters. 

2. Calibrate the ultrasound position over the motor cortex. I'm using combined stim/measure electrode with 2v out 16khz current. I am still having trouble calibrating - I do think the coating is a problem. There is pressure coming out, I can calibrate easily in saline. 

3. gain 500 , 10k low pass. ae_r 
   - PRF 80 - 1Hz LED. 
   - PRF 80 10Hz LED. 

4. gain = 500, 10k low pass on preamp, ae_r 
    - PRF 40, 10Hz LED. 
    - PRF 40, 1Hz LED. 

Mouse is waking. Game is over. 1hr 19 minutes. 

I didn't have time for two tone test - also I don't have enough electrode spots. 
Mouse moved to warming chamber. 11:30am. 

= = = = 

I simply don't have enough electrodes to do this. 
TWO TONE modified. It should look like 17 microvolts on the FFT with 10k filter in place. 
5. What is the amplitude of the 500kHz signal without the filter? 
Two tone test? Apply this all with single electrode?  
Then do VEPS the same as I was before. This isnt a good control as veps might change.

- Evidence points to nail polish on head being a problem. Head is hard and reflective. This is good to know. Some pressure is getting through - just not much.
