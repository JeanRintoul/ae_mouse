================================================== 

1. I fixed the mouse_stream code which was failing a lot... i need to only set the jitter when I need it. 

2. Now if I turn up the gain i can see the 1020. Gain = 100 
   Previously, I used gain = 100 to do this map. 

Notably, and excitingly... the electrical noise is extremely low now... ringing in at 

I can see the PRF signal, it is pretty low now with gain = 100, but definitely there and perfectly shaped at the focus. The baseline is 0. As it should be. I could use this again as a calibration method in the mouse. 

I decided not to do the whole map of nothing, simply a cross to mimic the cross I did with no F21. 
Note: toward the end there was a conductive connection of gel on the edge. The result is clear though. The F21 obliterates the electrical signal. 

The results are in excel files.

Electrical version: 
- PRF electrical signal and direct 1khz. Can I see a difference frequency? Mixing the f mixing product of the prf wave with direct applied 1khz(+df). Yes I can see the difference frequency. 

file 1: shows 100Hz as the difference frequency. i.e. my carrier is at 500khz, pulsed at 1khz. I then apply 1khz + 100Hz directly. I can now see the difference frequency in solution. 

file 2: dfx = 1Hz I can also see it when I am at 1Hz, but I don't have enough reps in my FFT to give a good answer. 

file 3: superimpose 1001Hz and this 500khz pulse? So I have a modulated signal? This is what I need to implement to be able to run it through the RF antenna. 

- So what do I plan to do tomorrow... 1000Hz... 
   - Do I get a MEP when I apply the signal directly this way? i.e. 1000 Hz directly (through mouth and brain electrodes), and 500khz pulse through electrode in gel. 
   - If I do get a MEP in this way, I should then try the superposition signal through the RF antenna. 
     This means I should make it so I can try this signal in saline first... I am not actually sure this will work through the antenna as an entire signal. 
     - what will work is if I just send the high frequency pulse signal through the antenna, and apply 1khz directly. I am already set up to do this. 
     - this still relies on ionic mixing in solution. Good enough I think.

Mouse plan: 
The low frequency signal is direct connected to mouse brain. The high frequency signal can be in gel, via RF antenna, or via ultrasound.

- Transmission spectrum when I vary the carrier for directly applied wave. I can apply this with a function generator so that I can see the entire spectrum. 

So I am applying the waveform without the rf amplifier, and without the bono current source so I can reach all frequencies. 

Transmission spectrum
  apply two sine waves of carrier frequency x. 

I have saved out a file. 
carriers =[40,100, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 4000, 8000, 10000, 30000, 50000,100000,250000,500000,750000,1000000,2000000]
10Hz difference frequency
I send out the same amplitude signal every time. 
Fs = 5MHz. 

I am not using the preamp as the amplitudes are too big, so everything is just going directly in through channel 1 of my daq. hence, no filters. 

format of transmission file: 
thingstosave.append([i_data,v_data,z,2*fft_m[dfx_idx],2*fft_m[carrier_idx],2*fft_v[carrier_idx]])


Looks like DF goes down then up with frequency... I missed the lower end of the spectrum due to this not transmitting before... This is the end of the spectrum I should harness.

Synopsis: 
It seems that for the difference frequency to effect cells, the carrier needs to be low.

As frequency of source voltage increases, capacitive reactance decreases and current increases.

Xc = 1/ 

The equation for capacitance is inversely proportional to frequency. 

What is the equation for capacitive cell membrane wrt frequency? 




TODO: Applying two separate source sine waves directly, pulse one, and direct other one.
