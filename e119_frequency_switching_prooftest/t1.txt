t1 - frequency switching test. 
================================================== 

RF_TI_fswitching. 
1. Frequency switching waveform. Fs = 5e6, going for 4 seconds. switching between 500khz, and 501khz. 
0.5 PRF, burst length 0.25 seconds. 
Analyze later. Do a spectrogram. 

Can I run everything at 10MHz? 
2. Result is I need to create a new piece of code, specifically for very high sample rates.
