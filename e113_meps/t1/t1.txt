- trouble with headbar fit. This time, the glue from holding the ears back is in the way. I had to do some trimming to get it to fit. Not ideal. 
The amplitude of the electric signal from the rf amplifier is super big. 

preamp settings 3k low pass. 500 gain. 
First, locate the pressure focus with ae_calibrate_with_prf.py over the motor cortex. 

- measure the df amplitude at a range of frequencies. (so I can compare against the phantom). 
GOAL: Obtain the amplitude at the center point as mouse is waking for 
df = 1hz, 
df = 2hz, 
df = 5hz 
df = 10hz
df = 40hz
df = 100hz. 

- measure the df with v only, p only and then both. df = 2hz. 

- can i see spike data at the df? 2hz. To do this ideally I will need a few recordings of longer duration.  

- remove the preamp at the end, and measure behavioral data at higher voltages. 

= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = 

- took 30 minutes to trim it into the right amplitude. 
- my rf amplifier seems to have lots of noise again. 
- skip the accurate positioning.

1. 5hz df, amplitude is huge! vout = 1v. but my rf amplifier volts r big. gain = 1. 

2. gain = 100. df = 5. the neural df is giant... 2500 micrvolts... 

GAIN = 100. 3k low pass. duration = 6 seconds. 
3. df = 1Hz. amplitude = 4000 microvolts in fft. 

4. df = 2Hz. amplitude = 3650 microvolts in fft. 

5. df = 5hz. amplitude = 3400 microvolts. 

6. df = 10. amplitude 3400 microvolts.

7. df = 40, amplitude 2500 

8. df = 100, df = 3400? 

- - - something cannot be right? 

9. no signals applied, gain = 100. I can see the 1Hz. 

10. pressure only 1MPa. 

11. Current only. 1v output. 

12. Both. df = 1hz. vout = 1v. 

13. df = 1hz. vout = 2 (3k lowpass). HUGE amplitude. 

14. df = 1Hz. move transducer backward. v out = 1v. 

Note: red one was on the visual cortex. so swap polarity for all recorded files here. 

What I think is happening, is that my v out is picking up on the electrical PRF and is adjusting to it... Thus, my vout is delivering the df directly. 

15. df =1. Using mineral oil guard. The amplitude has almost completely disappeared? The voltage data is once again very clean.... 

16. df = 1, v out = 1v, mineral oil. 

17. df = 1, v out = 2v, mineral oil. 

18. df = 1, vout = 3v, mineral oil.  (i can see that now i get that non-linear mixing thing at 5x and 10x)

19. df = 2 vout = 3   (oil is leaking...)
    amplitude looks big again? 
20. df = 2, v out = 3

21. df = 2 vout = 3 moved it up a bit. 

22. df = 2, vout = 1   (started twitching) (its there, its just i do not know if it is due to water leaking out etc. )

23. df = 2, vout =1 nothing

24. preamp off. turn up amplitude of v out = 4, df = 2.

Water is once again leaking out. 

14:30... moved into warming chamber. Mouse has oil on it. 

Check any past data, to see if the vout does not also contain the difference frequency, as it is mixing with the PRF. 

The mouse should now fit in the neurotar. In future surgeries, I should pay careful attention to how their ears are glued back. 

TODO:  

Result: I definitely need to electrically isolate the transducer. I think that perhaps filling the cone with oil would be better - it just seems really hard to do. 

Bring in the bottle of mineral oil. 

= = = = = 

END RESULT: I think this is electrical mixing and not true acoustoelectric mixing, but I need to test this with the mineral oil in the US cone.
