t2 - MEPS test in mouse. 
============================================ 

Note: In this experiment, when gain =1, my amplification is too low to see spikes. When gain goes to 100 - I can see spikes.

Phantom test for electrical mixing worked, so repeat in the mouse.

MEPS Mouse Experiment Plan: 

preamp settings 3k low pass. 500 gain. 
First, locate the pressure focus with ae_calibrate_with_prf.py over the motor cortex. 

KEY TESTS: 
- Apply df = 2Hz, and do a measurement without F21. Can I see spikes? 
- Apply df = 2Hz, with F21... Can I see spikes?
- Electrical mixing test: Note the amplitude of the 500kHz electrical signal. This will be what I need to apply.

- - - - - 

Bonus experiments (all with F21): 

- measure the df amplitude at a range of frequencies. (so I can compare against the phantom). 
df = 1hz, 
df = 2hz, 
df = 5hz 
df = 10hz
df = 40hz
df = 100hz. 

- measure the df with v only, p only and then both. df = 2hz. Then apply no signals and do a measurement. 

- do 10 repeats so I can create a spike map with stat sig at df = 2Hz. 

- remove the preamp at the end, and measure behavioral data at higher voltages.

- red on other side - remeber to add a -ve when analysing. 

I did NOT find the focus, as this doesn't seem to be working right now due to transducer weirdness. 

preamp low pass 300Hz, gain = 1. 
Current amplitude = 2V. 
1. NO F21. dfx = 2hz (preamp with 300hz filter)
2. No F21  dfx = 2hz  hug df at 2hz

3. With thin F21. dfx = 2 900 microvolt
4. With thin F21. dfx = 2 900 microvolt. (pretty clear)
5. With thin F21. dfx = 2 900 microvolt. (pretty clear)
6. no filters, F21, dfx =2hz. 

Electrical Mixing test. dfx = 10Hz. 
No filters on preamp, gain = 1. v = 1.5V out.  
7. the amplitude was a bit too small. 
8. dfx = 10. vout = 2v. Now I can see it clearly. (2V shall be my mixing test setting)
9. What is the amplitude of the applied PRF from the ultrasound (turn off voltage)
    8078 microvolts. 
10. repeat. center frequency amplitude from US = 8083 microvolts. 
11. Now calibrate applied current center frequency to be the same height. 
    vout of pressure generator = 0.32
   0.4  = 10000
   0.3  = 7750
   0.32 = 8190 microvolts. 

Gain =1, no filter for all of below e mixing test. 
   Test for electrical mixing.
12,13,14,15,16. vout main generator = 2V. vout prf immitator = 0.32. to get 8190 microvolts on measurement electrodes.     
Do I see a df of 10Hz? no mixing apparent. 
This shows that the mixing is NOT happening due to electrical mixing. 
Go back to US with same settings and repeat a bunch of times. 

Ultrasound ON: dfx = 10, gain = 1 (now I see sizeable mixing at 10Hz)
17,18,19,20,21

- measure the df amplitude at a range of frequencies. (so I can compare against the mouse). 
df = 1hz, 
df = 2hz, 
df = 5hz 
df = 10hz
df = 40hz
df = 100hz
vout = 2v. 
no filters on preamp. 
22. dfx = 1Hz. seems small amplitude but there. 
23. 2hz pretty clear
24. 5hz
25. 10hz
26. 40hz
27  100hz

Repeat with 300hz low pass filter, gain = 100. vout =2V. 
28. df  = 1 really visible. looks excellent. Though only about 1000 microvolts. 
29  df  = 2 
30  df  = 5 
31  df  = 10 
32  df  = 40 
33  df  = 100

Maybe I shouldn't use Ch1? It isnt differential . 

Now remove the preamp and replace with ch1. , and start changing the volume to see a behavior. 
34. dfx = 1, vout = 2, pp height in raw data is barely there. 

35. dfx = 1, vout = 6, pp is cant really see. 

36. dfx = 1, vout = 10 

37. dfx = 2 vout = 10 

38. switch to ch5(diff ch). dfx = 2 vout = 10 - i can kind of see it

39. pressure = 0.12, vout = 10. df = 2 (whiskers started moving)

40. pressure = 0.12, vout = 10. df = 1

41. pressure = 0.12, vout = 10. df = 3

42.  pressure = 0.12, vout = 10. df = 2

43. repeat
44. dfx = 1 all else same above. I see lots of weird low f harmonics... bnut not 1hz. Check out this data(remember channel 5)

I did not see behavioral data. Nor should I expect to  
15:11 end. 1 hr and 29 minutes. 
End

= The mouse performed well.
