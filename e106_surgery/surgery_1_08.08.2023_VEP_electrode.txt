pfc mouse, designed for high amplitude ketamine gamma waves: 


Electrode placement coordinates: 
PFC: AP 2.3-2.5, ML 0.4
MC:  AP 0.0,  ML 2.0 left of bregma.

Surgery went ok. The electrodes were a little springy - so I should ensure that they are touching the skull in the right place. 
The PFC coordinate is a fair way in the front. 

TODOs: 
- Get more large pipettes. - Done. 
- double check k amounts. I think my dosages are too high. - Done. I am decreasing the dosage. 
- re-write protocol for what I am doing now, and print it out. I have this silicon, and a lot has changed since the screw protocol. - Done. 
- get more of the spray alcohol. - Done.
