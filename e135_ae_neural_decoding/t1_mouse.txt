- ensure that the two electrodes are not electrically connected via the gel. 

= = = = = = Goal = = = = = = = = =  

Spike demodulation (LED no US): 
- e135_vep.py 
Gain = 500, no filters. 8s duration. Fs = 5e6 
- 10 x vep 1hz. 
- 10 x vep shielded. 
- 10 x vep 4Hz. 

Acoustoelectric Neural Recording: 
- manually position the US transducer. i.e. guess. 
- run e135_ae_neural_recording.py 
Settings: 0.1Hz high pass. Gain = 1000, Fs = 2Mhz. Run for 12 seconds 
VEP at 1Hz, 2Hz, 4Hz, 5Hz, 6Hz. 
I don't need so many repeats of each here. I just need high amplitude VEPS. 

If I don't see anything I could try moving the transducer focus until I do see something. 

= = = = = = = = = = start: 10:19am = = = = = = = = = = = = 

Starting with ae neural recording: 

- Preamp: 0.3Hz high pass. Gain = 1000. Fs = 2MHz. Duration = 12. 
I have tape insulating one electrode(the one over the motor cortex). 

1. VEP 4Hz, I couldn't see the raw VEP at all. I can see it in the lfp signal. Something is wrong with my FFT? There marker chan time alignment is off. 
I'm using no pressure, and the LED, and still see no VEP. 
I have a VEP issue. 

2. Although there is no VEP in this mouse right now and I don't know why, This file is interesting because I can see the 2.6Hz from the ketamine delta wave in the modulated signal? Analyze this. 

3. again, the ketamine waveform appears in the modulated signal. gain = 500. 

What can I test with a VEPless mouse? 
I can try to add a signal, and determine if mixing is occuring in the preamp. 
I would need to add two signals, complex... and measure. 

4. maybe a tiny 4hz in the signal. gain = 1000. 

TODO: 
Is it the gel or the mouse? I took the gel off, cleaned with saline and soaked up excess saline with sugus. 

5. Is it the gel or my mouse? It appears to be my mouse. I can clearly see the ketamine waveform however. 

- mouse debugging. 
  - is this mouse just overused, or blind from old age or injury? 
  - are the implant electrodes secured well in the skull? 
mouse is faulty. 

I am seeing a periodic hf signal of some sort. What is this coming from? Maybe a power supply on the fritz? 

I do need to plan the mixing proof test. 

1hr 19 minutes, I place in warming chamber. 
11:30am. 

- replug the preamp. - done. 

I think I shouldn't use this mouse anymore. It doesn't have a VEP. 

Mixing proof test.
