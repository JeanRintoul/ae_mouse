t2 - acoustoelectric neural recording with ketamine. 
=================================================================

Ket/Xyl
drugs:

- ensure that the two electrodes are not electrically connected via the gel. 

The mouse doesn't fit into the headbar all that well. 
- Go back to the other style of implant. 
- metal is exposed at the back near hair. 
- I should do better cross-checking of fit during.  

- the straight up connection, gets in the way of the US transducer. 
- I put some new silicon over the MEP electrode. 28 minutes in. 

= = = = = = Goal = = = = = = = = =  

Spike demodulation (LED no US): 
- e135_vep.py 
Gain = 500, no filters. 8s duration. Fs = 5e6 
- 10 x vep 4Hz. - done
- 10 x vep 1hz. - done. 

Acoustoelectric Neural Recording: 
python e135_ae_neural_decoding.py 

- run e135_ae_neural_recording.py 
Settings: 0.1Hz high pass. Gain = 1000, Fs = 2Mhz. Run for 12 seconds 
VEP at 1Hz, 2Hz, 4Hz, 5Hz, 6Hz. 
I don't need so many repeats of each here. I just need high amplitude VEPS. 
US + 
1. 4hz vep. cannot see vep. I can see the ketamine modulated waveform though. It appears to have been modulated.  I recorded over the first one by accident when i switched. 
2. 2Hz vep. 
3. 8 hz vep. 
4. no US. 4Hz VEP. 


Another design problem is I need to bend it backwards to lower US over it. stupid. 


= = = = = = = = = = start:11am = = = = = = = = = = = = 

- into warming chamber 12:36am. 
- 1hr 37 minutes. 

Starting with ae neural recording: 
- Preamp: 0.3Hz high pass. Gain = 1000. Fs = 2MHz. Duration = 12. 
- I have tape insulating one electrode(the one over the motor cortex). 

Next time, start directly with ae_neural recording as it is a good indicator as to whether i am getting a vep or not.

It turns out the signal was ok, I am not sure why I didn't see it. 

Was it
