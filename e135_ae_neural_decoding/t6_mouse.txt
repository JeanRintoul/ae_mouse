- ensure that the two electrodes are not electrically connected via the gel. 

- calibrate position, using the VEP electrode as the current source, and two external to head references. 
- Perform F21, Kaiser windowed, and SNR averaged acoustoelectric neural recording. 
   Try at a couple of different VEP frequencies.

TODO: check the weight of all the small gas canisters. 
- The playdough thing is dumb. I need some other way that is low form factor to get wires in there. I think I should slip the wires through the neurotar itself so that the clamp works for the wires there. 

Position calibration notes: Position calibration appears to work, in that it gets bigger and smaller according to a focal pattern. However, I am not confident it is over the VEP electrode. It may be over the measurement electrode. TO figure out. 

Also, my SNR code takes a really long time. 

F21 in place, Gain = 500, 0.3Hz high pass on preamp, Duration = 12. Fs = 5e6.

running e134_ae_t5_g2.py 
1. 4Hz LED, 40 times. I am not seeing an SNR improvement like I did in saline. 
   I should look at this data afterwards. 
   My VEP size is only 2 microvolts - a bit small. 
   Hence I'd expect my demodulated vep to be about a thousandth the size. 

- Perhaps next time I start with doing a VEP test/Ketamine baseline test. 
Problem: VEP size too small? Why? 
TRY THE OTHER MOUSE, TRY 2Hz VEP. 
- On looking at the data the VEP was NOT too small. 
- Timing and LED synchronization looked really good. 
- Maybe I had US positioning issue? 

The other electrode over mortocortex was completely dry/isolated. good.
