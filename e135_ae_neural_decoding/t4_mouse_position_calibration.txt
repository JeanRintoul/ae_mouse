t4 - acoustoelectric neural recording with ketamine. 
=================================================================

Ket/Xyl

New experimental procedure: instead of IP injections, do ketamine and xylazine sub cut. 

The goal of this experiment: 
- Is it possible to do an accurate position calibration, using the preamp, and only two implanted electrodes? Yes. 
- Try to take a spike demodulation recording. LED 4Hz x 10, and no LED (just background ketamine x10). 2MHz 12 seconds is fine I think? keep gain the same at 500. 

- ensure that the two electrodes are not electrically connected via the gel. 

= = = = = = start time: 9:42am = = = = = =  

- Two implant calibratin with references in gel. 
  - I do appear to be calibrating. 
Acoustoelectric Neural Recording: 
python e135_ae_neural_decoding.py 


- run e135_ae_neural_recording.py 
Settings: Gain = 1000, Fs = 2Mhz. Run for 12 seconds. no filters. 

- ae_4hz 20x (gain = 1000)
- ae_2hz 20x (gain = 1000)

- Ketamine baseline (no LED) 10x (gain = 500) - looks weird. Investigate, hs lots of noise but the previous recordings at g 1000 didnt? 
- VEP_4Hz 10x (gain = 500). Again - this had noise in it. Not sure why. 


-- -- -- -- into warming chamber 1 hr 22 minutes after ketamine administration

- antisedan
- 50 saline. 
- 11.04am. 
- mouse awoke at 11:12ish, 1hr 30 minutes post ketamine administration.  
- given wet-mash in cage after recovery. 

Result summary: 
- I could calibrate position. This means I can do a single implant surgery tomorrow. 
- Did I get acoustoelectric neural recording? NOT AT ALL. The ae amplitudes were small when I calibrated position compared to gel. I need to figure out why.  

- 
- It's possible the skull coating is a problem. 

 
TODOs: 
- get more of those tiny little plastic tubes from BD? 
- update my ketamine/xylazine protocol to include sub cut injections instead of IP.
