I covered head with glue, then nail polish. When I drilled the holes I did not cover them with nail polish, 
but instead used the silcon as it is more acoustically transparent. 

- I am trying Jon's Ra IMPLANT	FOR THE FIRST TIME. 
- Tested successfully with multi-meter. It was very tight to fit the plug in though. 
   This could make it hard to insert later. 

Total surgery time:  1hr 47 minutes. 
Into warming chamber at 15:47.
