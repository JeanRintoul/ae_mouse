TODO: pick up more syringes. 

Male mouse, 4 months old. weight 26.7g. 

TODO: 
-get more syringes
-get more sterile swabs from downstairs. 
-get another oxygen cylinder up here. 

Surgery notes: 
- straight back head bar. 
- I placed gel glue around the edge, then covered ONLY the edges with clear nail polish, let dry - THEN applied the dental cement. 
- The center of the head where the US will be was left clear. At the end I covered the entire inner region with the quick dry silicon to encapsulate moisture and keep skull moist(lower the acoustic impedance)
- electrode in visual cortex is quite deep. 

Surgery duration under iso:  1hr 22

Consider doing a second surgery, so I have 2 new mice.
