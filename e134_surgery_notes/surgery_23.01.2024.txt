Male mouse, 2.5 months old. weight 25.4g. 

Next time, check on weight of all small gas canisters. 


Surgery notes: 
- I switched back to straight back head bar as it doesn't get in the way of the US. 
- This time I skipped the loctite 401 skull layer, nor did I put nail polish over the head. 
- I placed gel glue around the edge, then covered ONLY the edges with clear nail polish, let dry - THEN applied the dental cement. 
- The center of the head where the US will be was left clear. At the end I covered the entire inner region with the quick dry silicon to encapsulate moisture and keep skull moist(lower the acoustic impedance)

Surgery duration under iso:  1 hr 44minutes. 

Note: This mouse had no VEP.
