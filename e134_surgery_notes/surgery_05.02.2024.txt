Male mouse, 2.7 months old. weight 24g. 

Surgery notes: 
- I switched back to straight back head bar as it doesn't get in the way of the US. 
- No nail polish on middle of head, just on edges. 
- silicon layer over skull to keep moisture in. 
Surgery duration under iso:  1 hr 24minutes. 

into warming chamber at 12:44am. 

TODO if I have a problem: If I have trouble with VEPs, I should remove the silicon, and re-insert the electrode.
