Male mouse, 4 months old. weight 27.5g. 

TODO: 
-get another oxygen cylinder up here. 

Surgery notes: 
- straight back head bar. 
- I placed gel glue around the edge, then covered ONLY the edges with clear nail polish, let dry - THEN applied the dental cement. 
- The center of the head where the US will be was left clear. At the end I covered the entire inner region with the quick dry silicon to encapsulate moisture and keep skull moist(lower the acoustic impedance)


Surgery duration under iso: 1hr 12 minutes. 
This is the second surgery of the day, so I have two new mice in simultaneous recovery for greater efficiency.
