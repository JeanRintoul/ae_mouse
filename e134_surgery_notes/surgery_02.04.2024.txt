Basic electrode surgery. PtIr electrodes. 

Went fine. Though the VEP electrode was a bit springy in position. I put silicon. The implant is positioned a bit far forward for my liking. 

I did my best. 
It is not ideal, but likely still usable. 

surgery end at 15:40 , 1hr 45 minutes under iso. 

pick up new m sized gloves, and 50 cc insulin syringes.
