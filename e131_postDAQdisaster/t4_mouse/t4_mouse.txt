Goal: Ketamine. 
- obtain a VEPs under ketamine. VEP needs no complex arrangement. 
- then try acoustoelectric neural recording with a VEP? Try for a few different PRFs. 

========  start time : 13:36   ======= 

Fs = 5Mhz, once a second LED. Gain = 500, no preamp filters. 
VEPS files 1:20, 8Hz VEP, 1HZ VEPS.

=== 

Calibrate US position. Didn't work again. Not sure why. I tried the prf method. 
I think I now have a very small electrical signal... so all amplitudes for this are tiny. 

- i think it doesnt work because the electrical signal is now small.

e131_ae_r neural recording. 
10k low pass filter. 
PRF 1020. LED 4Hz. Gain = 500 
PRF 520. LED 4Hz. Gain = 500 
PRF 120. LED 4Hz. Gain = 500 
Then do it at 500khz. NO filters. 
then do it again at 500khz, 8hz led, no filters. g = 100. 
8hz led PRF 1020, gain = 100. 

Gain 500 seems strange, maybe it is broken. 

The LED may be in the wrong position for some of the recordings. particularly in the first continuous one. 

=== === 
Try some US neuromodulation at the end. 
I am not seeing any neuromodulation. 
I am tired. 
1 hr 27 minutes. 

=== End === 15:12
1hr 37 minutes. 

Why isn't ultrasound neuromodulation working anymore? 
It may be because I have far less electrical noise. Hence the amplitude of my mixing products from the ultrasound is very small. This appears true in my calibration. 

To overcome this, I should apply an electrical signal at high frequency to the mouse.
