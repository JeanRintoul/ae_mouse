Goal:
- obtain an electrical stim ERP. 
- obtain a VEP. 

Isoflurane, 0.75: 
1. VEPS. 1 per second. Get a good sample set of 50 - enough to do averaging. Do it in the dark. Can I see the VEP? 
2. Pulsed electrical stimulation at 500Hz stim frequency, such that I can see the response each time? Then do post analysis to obtain ERP. Motor cortex and chest electrode. 
3. consider pulsed electrical stimulation at a higher carrier frequency, to get null ERP result. 

Code: e131_pulse.py 

========  start time : 12:37   ======= 

VEPS Files 1:20, about 8 veps per file. 
Fs = 5Mhz, once a second LED. Gain = 500, ISO = 0.75, no preamp filters. 
1-20. Positive electrode red on visual cortex connected to 1. on left input of preamp. The last channel is the marker channel. 

=== === === === === === === === === ===

ERPS from e pulse stim. Stim is applied with gel on top of measurement electrodes. Sceond electrode is wet with gel and under chest. 
 Files 1:20. 
100Hz pulse, once per second. Iso = 0.75 
Gain = 100. 2v output. No filters. 

21-40 100khz carrier pulse. otherwise the same. 1 second 50ms pulse length. 

Note: no movements visible. I may need to do this test with ketamine so i can simultaneously see the physical ERP. 

=== === === 

Try VEP mixing with e stim? at 500Hz carrier? Lower amplitude 500hz - say 1V only. 100 gain. Iso = 1.0 

1hz vep i.e. frequency            = 2        # 0.25s duration, 1 on every second.


Also try 4hz vep. 
frequency            = 8        # 0.0625 duration, 1 on every 0.25s.

== END time: 1 hr 40 min under iso. 
14:17.
