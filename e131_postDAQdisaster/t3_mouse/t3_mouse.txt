Ketamine. 
Goal:
- obtain a VEP under ketamine. VEP needs no complex arrangement. 
- obtain an electrical stim ERP under ketamine. 
  - e stim pulse ERP at 500Hz and 100kHz. Try to do it such that I see movement too. 
- VEP electrical mixing at 500Hz carrier? Change the stim electrode to the VEP area to do this. 

- then try acoustoelectric neural recording with a VEP? 

Note: this is a different mouse to the one I did the VEPS on yesterday. 

========  start time : 9:38am   ======= 
Fs = 5Mhz, once a second LED. Gain = 500, no preamp filters. 
VEPS Files 1:20, 4Hz VEP, 1HZ VEPS.

ERPS. I cannot get a response, and measure with the preamp at the same time. Possibly because preamp is low impedance input and routes some current to it. 
Hence I am using the diff input with high impedance ch 6. daq range 2v. 

- First, get a pulse ERP that induces something visible of any sort. Small is fine. 

Note: For these, analyze the ch 6 for ERPS. 
For some reason I cannot make the pulse shorter. Why not? 

- I did recordings 10 times, for 500Hz and 50kHz. 

- big tail movements at 500Hz. 1hr in. 

1hr 9 min, whisker movements - k is starting to weaken. 

= = VEP MIX with 500Hz. = = = 

If I have time, do VEP mix at 500Hz with very small amplitude. 
500hz over VEP electrode. GND in mouth. 

Mouse is starting to wake and have spontaneous movements. 
vout = 0.01 500Hz. gain = 100, haven't looked at any of the outputs. 
1:12. 

I then did it for an 8Hz LED flash as well. Gain = 100. 

========= finish 1 hr 26 minutes. 
warming chamber at 11: 06am.
