t4 - phantom
===========================================================================

Data: 13/05/2024

- First, calibrate the position with dual sine mep. This worked really well. There is a clear peak. 10 microvolts at 2MPa. I am measuring with the PtIR probes connected through to the low pass filter at 6Hz df. This df is definitely very focal. 

Measurement settings: 
preamp is 3khz low pass, and has gain = 500, duration = 6 seconds. 4 recordings of each. p out = 0.2, i.e. 2MPa. 
There is intentionally no filter at the low frequencies so I can see DC drift. 
Fs = 5e6 

1. Dual sine mep amplitude with frequency, 4 recordings at df = 0.5Hz, 1Hz, 2Hz, 4Hz, 8hz, 12hz, 20Hz, 40Hz. gain = 500. 

In each case, the df is extremely clear. I can see it in the raw data... easy to see why this is inducing neuromodulation. 
0.5hz (95microvolts pp)
1Hz (51.7 microvolts)
2Hz (44.2 microvolts)
4hz (29.43 microvolts)
8hz (7.19 microvolts pp)
20hz (5.92 microvolts pp)
40hz (2.27 microvolts pp)

2. ae mep amplitude with frequency (no F21). 4 recordings at df = 0.5Hz, 1Hz, 2Hz, 4Hz, 8hz, 12hz, 20Hz, 40Hz. 2MPz, and vout = 5V. gain = 100. I am using the PtIr wires as measurement, and the stim is one between them, and the other distant and using bonos current source.  

0.5hz (123microvolts pp) - the peak itself is not clear. 
1Hz (5.65 microvolts) - nothing there. something went wrong here. 
2Hz (14.69 microvolts) - the peak is not super clear and the amplitude all the way up to it seems larger. 
4hz (40.7 microvolts) - the peak is now clear. 
8hz (15.6 microvolts pp) - 
20hz (17.3 microvolts pp) - 
40hz (2.6 microvolts pp) - clear peak

3. ae mep amplitude with frequency (with F21). Otherwise this has the same settings as 2. gain = 100. 

0.5hz (127microvolts pp) - the peak itself is not clear. big DC
1Hz (38 microvolts) - clear peak, but smaller in amplitude than hoped. 
2Hz (14microvolts) - no clear peak
4hz (25 microvolts) - beautifully clear. 
8hz (39.76 microvolts pp) - clear peak. 
20hz (6.53 microvolts pp) - clear peak
40hz (16 microvolts pp) - clear peak. 

4. dual mep with same settings as 1. but using F21. gain = 500. 

0.5hz (18microvolts pp) - clear
1Hz (11.7 microvolts) - clear, smaller DC than the ae meps. 
2Hz (6.96 microvolts) - clear
4hz (3.14 microvolts) - clear
8hz (1.52 microvolts pp) - clear
20hz (1.2 microvolts pp) - clear 
40hz (0.6 microvolts pp) - 

The ae meps are effected by both the current mixing from the ultrasound and the direct current ionic electrochemistry issue. So this DC low frequency effect is going to be a much bigger issue. 

The smallest amplitudes are when we shield the electric signal with F21, meaning the acoustoelectric effect from the ultrasound is attenuated. 


5. lastly, electrical impedance plot for the same frequencies. I want to do this with the simple resistor as I think it is more accurate(not bonos thing), and do it between the PtIr probes. I inject 1V between the PtIr probes, and calculate the impedance. I repeat each measurement 4 times. 6 seconds duration. 

0.5hz    - 43.9kohm
1Hz      - 36.38kohm
2Hz      - 29.7kohm
4hz      - 22.38kohm
8hz      - 16.01kohm
20hz     - 9.5kohm
40hz     - 6.355kohm
2000hz   - 2.21kohm
500000hz - 0.987 kohm

Result: 
The reason I am not getting ae meps is NOT amplitude related, it is due to there being all these other electrical frequencies all intermodulating when signal is applied. Though when using F21 I likely need to turn up the amplitude as it does attenuate the pressure too. 
- I can try ae meps at 4hz or above without F21? 
- I can use F21 and do ae meps, but at higher pressure and voltage.
