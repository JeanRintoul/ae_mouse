t6 - meps test  m4 mouse. 
===================================

EMEPS only. 
Which electrical stimulation electrode position, yields paw movements at the lowest voltage? 

1.3 mA minimum to see a paw movement, the cup electrode is working best in mouth.

==============================


1. continuity test. Continuity test passed. Implant is connected. 

1hz, 5v signal. 

2. 

-  cup electrode in mouth, Using resistor based direct voltage application. 
   - 5v works, 4v tiny mouth movement. impedance = 6.6k. 
- both ptir electrodes 
   - 5v nothing, 4v nothing. impedance = 7.7k. 
- wire electrode touching skull on other hemisphere with gel and motor cortex electrode. 
   - 5v nothing, impedance = 10k. 

- cheek hair removal. 

- cheeck electrode contralateral to the motor cortex electrode. 
   5v:nothing, impedance = 11.2k

- cheeck electrode contralateral the motor cortex electrode. bigger movement. 
   5v: movement, particularly on cheek and side which has cup impedance 6.3k. 

- cheek electrode on same side as the motor cortex electrode. using cup electrode on cheek
  5v, impedance - 19.4k
   
- mouth again with cup electrode, 
    5v: big movement. maybe I am just stimulating mouth with cup electrode? impedance 5.8k. 

- can I use two large surface area electrodes? one thick wire on head, one cup in mouth? 
     5v: tiny movement of mouth only... impedance 6.5k. 

- changing the polarity, going back to one cup electrode in mouth and ptir electrode in brain. 
   5v: larger mouth response. impedance = 5.8k. 

- original polarity. 
   5v: still getting big mouth response. impedance 6.5k. 

Switch to david bonos one - bipolar. Not getting anything out? oh yeah, it cannot do low frequencies... 

I switch to the visual cortex electrode being stim, and suddenly response was bigger? 
- response is bigger when I use the visual cortex electrode? weird... 

suddenly the impedance has changed. I do not know why. up at 70k. oh it was unplugged. good reason.  
back ti 5.9k impedance.

the mouth electrode is definitely the way to go... 

Does the voltage change with time? 1.65ma. 

Time: 1hr 19 minutes. 

1hr 20 minutes 5v, i get small paw movement and jaw movement, 4v i get small whisker movement. 

Confirmed: I am getting a larger movement with the visual cortex electrode and the cup mouth electrode. 

Can I use lower values as I come out of anesthesia? 

1hr 30 mins: i get small paw movement and jaw movement, 4v i get small whisker movement. 

I am starting to get spontaneous movements, mouse is waking. 

1hr 32 mins. everything has suddenly change
i get big paw movement and jaw movement, 4v i get small whisker movement.

still need  5v, 1.3 ma before I see anything. 

- It is actually easier to see movement when there are no spontaneous movements. 

stop. It doesn't seem like i suddenly need less current to obtain stimulation. 

That's interesting and means the whole experiment is good for applying US? 

= = = 

to consider: 
- use bonos source at its highest output. 
- use visual cortex electrode as the stim electrode. 
- try to look for whisker movements instead of whole paw movements. 
- consider inserting EMG electrode if I think I have something. 
- calibrate the position of the US using the AE effect itself. Is it bigger in any one direction? Measure with the cheek electrode and other head electrode... i.e. EMG.
