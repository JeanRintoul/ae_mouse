t7 - ae meps test  m3 mouse. 
===================================

- use bonos source at its highest output. 
- use visual cortex electrode as the stim electrode. 
- try to look for whisker movements instead of whole paw movements. 
- consider inserting EMG electrode if I think I have something. 
- calibrate the position of the US using the AE effect itself. Is it bigger in any one direction? Measure with the cheek electrode and other head electrode... i.e. EMG.

- set up with cup cheek electrode and brain electrode for measure, 
- cup electrode in mouth and motor cortex electrode for stim using d bonos voltage out. 

ae mep is doing unstable weird things and led is flashing when on... 
- switch back to the original direct current source. 
- all of a sudden my GND is fixed. 
I am not seeing any df. 

If I put the voltage up too high, i get a weird non-linear effect in the preamp. 
==============================

gain = 200. 
vout  = 10  - if i go above this i get a weird non-linear effect in the preamp. 
df    = 4 hz
pout = 0.4 
filter 0.3 -> 1k

calibrating position - it is focal and reliably repeatably so.

Lets do a frequency ramp with these settings. 
1hz (241 microvolts) - less clear
2hz (265)
4hz (231)
8hz (163)
20hz (137)
40hz  (91)

gain up to 500 - it doesn't saturate, seems all reasonable... 

wait a while for mouse anesthesia to lighten? Im at 1hr 20 minutes.

I can see the ae signal very clearly. 
I cannot see anything in the EMG, though... the mouse is totally still and I am at 1hr 24 mins. 

So I have achieved a large ae signal... calibrating position helped enhance the size too. 

However, it isn't large enough to induce neuromodulation. 

1hr30 minus 300 microvolts pp 1Hz. 

1hr 33m - i got some  whiskers. 310 microvolts. 

1hr 34 360 microvolts. whiskers in general? 

1hr 35 398 micrvolts pp some stuff inc paw, 

1hr 36 386 microvolts. small whiskers. 

1hr 38 265 microvolts(paw)

1hr 40 mins (mouse moves but not at 1hz)


Does it look the same when I apply pressure only? 

pressure_only_1hr40 - yes

2hz at 445 microvolts. 1hr 46 

1hz - 1hr 47 498 

- It appears that the df amplitude is getting bigger as the neurons turn on. 

1hz - 1hr 50 429 microvolts . 

1hz 1hr 52. 488 microvolts. 

I think just the DC offset from the US is having an effect. 

If I go to p out = 0.3, i see nothing. amplitude far smaller too. Switch back to p out = 0.4. 

1hz 1hr 54 , 596 microvolts. 

1hr 55, 472 microvolts. 

2hr - 551 microvolts... 

NOTE: I have this 0.3Hz filter on during this time. 

suddenly the amplitude has gone down. 

TODO: time stamp files. showing this. 

The DC effects the amplitude. 

Suddenly the amplitude is much smaller, now the mouse is waking. There is a large onset effect though. 

Can I distinguish the ae field, from pressure only? 

1hz 2hr 7 min. - the 1hz effect has gone away - and I just have an onset effect? 

suddenly i dont see the 1hz, but i see a sudden shift at onset. 

2hr 11 minute moved to warming chamber. 15:55

- I got a pretty big amplitude at the difference frequency. That wasn't the problem. 
- calibrating position worked really well. 

- There seemed to be a pattern that the amplitude increase though the signal applied stayed the same as the mouse woke up. Then finaly - this was not the case and the signal went away, leaving mostly an onset effect.  

I couldn't see anything in the EMG. maybe there is a better way to do that. The cup electrode on the cheek may not be the best location. 

As the mouse came to consciousness, the 

Evidence of ae effect: 
As the mouse comes out of consciousness, the amplitude of the df increases, suggesting there is neural synchrony. 
It is sub threshold however, thus doesn't induce movement.

The DC offset induce from both electrical and US are above the movement threshold, and confound the result otherwise. 

I could consider doing the electrical stim the opposite polarity, to try to minimize the DC offsety? 

Analyse that DC offset data.
