t3 - meps test - Can I get MEPs using ketamine. 
===========================================================================

Mouse M5 - vertical implant mouse. 
Ensure that the two electrodes are not connected in the gel. 
keep the two electrodes electrically isolated from each other. 
Mice with vertical headbars and dubious connection. Must perform multimeter connection test first, and attempt to fix.

e141_ae_calibrate.py 
e141_vep.py    (to see when the neurons reconnect)
e141_dualsine_mep.py (with and without GNDing) - do I get a movement in either case? 
e141_ae_mep.py (can I get this working?) Have some thoughts on how to improve it. 

==============================

The ketamine dose is so low, it takes a while to settle into it. 
Both electrodes are connected. 

1. Do connectivity tests and re-nail polish to guarantee insulation. Connected. 
   Put nail polish on the VEP electrode, it was exposed. 

2. e meps. cup electrode in mouth. I ramp the voltage output seeking a mep response by eye. I get it at 5V output. The mouse is at max K depth. This is pretty big... One cup electrode in mouth, the other over motor cortex. 

3.  I use 5V out, but use both the electrodes that are in the brain. No response. The position really matters. 

4. Now, reverse the polarity of the cup and motor cortex electrode. Same effect. 

5. Try a chest electrode. Can I get an emep response with it? Doesnt look like it. No... the mouth works much better, I can see whole body response at 7V output. 

I think I need a high field gradient, going through the motor cortex to do this. 

6. Set up ultrasound and try dual meps. 
   This time I used the visual cortex electrode and chest electrode to measure the signal, and left the motor cortex and cup electrode hooked up to stim. 
   I have the low pass filter in place. 

   I can now measure the dual mep signal quite well. gain = 500. I cannot yet get a response as ketamine level is too high. 

   Weird power fault. I turned the UPS off and rebooted everything, moved the mouse to the warming chamber. 

7. Dual meps works again... .

What I need is a plan to iterate and determine which amplitude of ae signal I need, to generate a response, by using emeps? 

switch to bono isolated voltage source. 

8. ae meps. 
   measuring it this way seems to have a large dc offset... 

 If I put the pressure up too much, I seem to induce some sort of surge state on the NAS and everything shuts down. 

Where is the RF amplifier plugged in? I think the RF amplifier needs to be plugged into the mains to avoid this surge state. 

I put the RF amplifier into the mains socket so it doesn't go through the UPS. 

9. pressure out = 0.3. No surge induced... clear 1Hz visible. 13.4 microvolts. 

pressure = 0.4 - bubbles suddenly appear at this pressure... df = 105 microvolts. 


I am seeing movements, sometimes they even seem to correlate... but I also cannot get the dual sine mep right now. 

TODO: 
- Need to update ae mep code so only comput fft on central part. 
- Also it should start in such a way as it is small then goes big, not at maxima. 


try emep:  i couldnt get it, though i could get it at the start. There is a more general error here in what I am doing. 


Go back and look at when I successfully got emeps - where were the electrodes? How did I do it? 

TODO: 
- go to cafe and add back that amplitude with respect to frequency in saline and phantom, as well as the relationship with ionic mobility plot. 
- Figure out a plan to iterate to a movement using ae meps, by alternating between consciouness measurement, and emeps.
