t1 - meps test  m4 mouse. 
===================================

First, do a phantom meps test to see if the LEDs can work. I might need a separate thonny file for meps. 

Do a position calibration over the front electrode. 

Goal: Attempt at meps test under ketamine. 

I will need to do a VEP test once in a while to determine when the neurons 'reconnect'.

1. Dual sine mep amplitude US only. With and without GNDing. Are the MEPS proportional to the electric field amplitude rather than the acoustic amplitude? i.e. ionic mixing. 
Get measurements of e field in vivo, and video if possible. 

2. Attempt AE MEP where the field is applied via neurotar single wire, and cup electrode in mouth. The US should be GNDed to minimize additional fields. 

3. If I get a response in any of these, also try with F21 in place, and absent. 
   Or try moving the gel to the side, as in the acoustic isolation test - such that the e field is still applied.

e141_ae_calibrate.py 
e141_vep.py    (to see when the neurons reconnect)
e141_dualsine_mep.py (with and without GNDing) - do I get a movement in either case? 
e141_ae_mep.py (can I get this working?) Have some thoughts on how to improve it. 

==============================

1. calibrate position. Didnt really work. I just positioned the US in the middle. 

2. VEP - I see giant ketamine baseline, and tiny VEP. 

3. gain = 500. no filters. 
   GNDED: dualsine mep at 1Hz df. 1Hz at 50 micrvolts. 
   UNGNDED: I got OVLD. 
   Even at gain = 1, it is MASSIVE at 1Hz. 
   I put the pressure down to 0.05v out, and I got a 500 microvolts signal at 1Hz,g=1, no railing. 

   I am successfully generating the df by removing the GND. This could be either electrical mixing or ionic mixing. 
   
   I am getting NO VEP... hence I wouldn't expect a movement from the mouse as the neurons are not connected. I can monitor both the ketamine signal delta amplitude, and the vep size.

4. UNGNDED - I got a massive 1Hz... but no movement. 

5. I am only getting a movement when the pressure is high, and the ultrasound is GND. 


6. gnded, p out = 0.2. 

I need a high pressure to do anything. 

- I got a movement with the dual mep, at high pressures. 
- I did not get a movement when it was ungrounded... I had trouble measuring at ungnded as the central freq was so high in the preamp. 
- I did not try AE MEP. 
- what is clear, is that pressure plays a role in ultrasound neuromodulation - and it is not ionic mixing? 
- I had a fairly short period at the end to do this. Ideally I should have used high pressures earlier. 

What is different is the gradient of the field. When an acoustoelectric effect takes place there is a gradient field? 

- I DID get the dual mep response when p out = 0.2. I need high pressure to generate it. 
- Next time try ae mep at 1hz. 

=== Logic pathway === 

- increasing the electric field did not alter the motor response. This suggests it is pressure alone that is generating it? What do I do with that, I say ae neuromodulation won't work, because the effect is independent of the electric field? I do know that acoustic modulation induces an electric field in both neurons and saline though. This is a localized effect requiring a localize current density. 

The means that perhaps ae neuromodulation will work, using a high gradient, high frequency field at the site of interest.
