t1 - meps test - Can I get MEPs using isoflurane? Lower body load, faster.
===========================================================================

Goal: Attempt at meps test under isoflurane at low levels iso = 0.5. 

Use the VEPs to determine consciousness level. Use the VEP test to determine when the neurons 'reconnect'.

1. Dual sine mep amplitude US only. High pressure amplitude to elicit movement such as p out = 0.2V. Does this work? 

2. Attempt AE MEPs where the e field is applied via neurotar single wire, and electrode under torso or in VEP electrode. The US should be GNDed to minimize additional fields. 

To do this I will need a filter in place if I do an electrical measurement... 
the low pass filter.

e141_ae_calibrate.py 
e141_vep.py    (to see when the neurons reconnect)
e141_dualsine_mep.py (with and without GNDing) - do I get a movement in either case? 
e141_ae_mep.py (can I get this working?) Have some thoughts on how to improve it. 

==============================



1. VEP - iso = 0.5. When I see vep run the dualsine mep code. 
   giant heat mat noise. 


2. dual sine mep, preamp 200 gain, filter band 0.03-1k, p vout = 0.3 
75 microvolts in amplitude. 

3. with my low pass filter, 200 gain. 63 microvolts df. 

Need to rearrange mouse legs by turning up iso, then repositioning. 

4. df = 2, gain = 500, pvout = 0.3. electrical amplitude 33 microvolts. 

5. df = 2, gain = 500, pvout = 0.3. electrical amplitude 50 microvolts. 

6. df = 2, gain = 500, pvout = 0.3. electrical amplitude 48 microvolts. I am not really seeing movement here... 

7. df = 1, gain = 500, pvout = 0.3. electrical amplitude 82 microvolts. I see sort of non-correlated movement here. 

8. df = 1 gain = 500. 49 micrvolts

9 df = 1, gain = 500, pvout = 0.5 - too high... mouse started doing way weird moving crazy. df = 761. too awake. I turned up the iso. 

I am not getting 

10. pvout = 0.3 df = 1 , everything super small suddenly, iso also at 0.7... 

11. try ae meps, just to get amplitudes... using this same filter arrangement. 

ae meps. start chest electrode gnd, and wire electrode through neurotar to deliver stim. 
iso = 0.5 
12. pvout = 0.3, lp filter in place, gain = 500. duration = 6s. 
   vout = 5, and I see a df at5 5Hz? 

13. df = 2 , df appears at 8Hz ? 16 microvolts. 

14. df = 0.5 , df appears at 2hz. 37 microvolts

df = 0.25, df appears at 1hz, 46 microvolts. pressure amplitude vout = 0.3, vout =  df= 0.25, but appears as 1hz. 

15 vout = 8 p out = 0.3  1hz amplitude ios clean and large. 75 microvolts. 
   check this file out... 

16 vout = 10 p out = 0.3  massive mixing amplitude... 150 microvolts. 

17.  vout = 10 p out = 0.4 amplitude 150 microvolts. 

18. repeat this, with F21 in place... 90 microvolts at 1Hz... 

The amplitude of the field I am generating just fine... there is something wrong with the way I am applying the field. 

19. vout = 10 p out = 0.4,  200 microvolts at 1Hz... 

Next step is to remove the preamp measurement, and apply the field at the head electrodes... I am just going to have to observe. 

20. stim electrode at motor cortex, and gnd electrode at vep location. Nothing. 

21. I see nothing. 

22. Can I send in just an electrical signal at 1Hz and see a movement? yes. But i am sending in a really high amplitude of 4v.straight to motor cortex. 
 
 Down at 1V I dont get any motion. 
 at 2V 1Hz I see small motion. 
 at 3V I see larger motion. I see motion, but it is not like the super neat and clean stuff I saw at the end of ketamine. It is hard to see the correlated paw movement. I am not consistently seeing movement at 4v output either... 

 I then switch the arrangement so motor cortex electrode and the chest gnd instead. 

 5v out I see some movement but it just isnt very clear really. Without the tape, I may just be getting shorting between the electrodes. 
  I cant record during this either. 

- - - - 
   Things look good for ae meps really... I just have to figure out the trick to applying the electric field. 

  Next mouse experiment: generate electric field meps only... can I do this cleanly? 

 So something is wrong with the way I simply apply an electric field... 
 If I cannot get a clean movement doing this - something is MORE wrong. 

 2 electrodes in motor cortex. 

 Solution, I think I need an optimized gradient field mouse. 
 Can I generate a high gradient field in vivo for ae meps? 

NOTE WELL: s
Next experiment: 
TODO: make sure the electrodes are electrically isolated from each other in the gel. Otherwise I cannot apply a large gradient field and have it go through the brain. 

Try to do just regular e meps. If I can do this, then switch to ae meps. 


Good points: 
- I can generate a large ae field. 
- This drops of exponentially with frequency same as the plots I had before of this. So those plots are definitely correct. 

Bad points: 
- The field may be travelling through the gel and not through the brain. This likely effected the results I got in this test, because I didnt put tape.
