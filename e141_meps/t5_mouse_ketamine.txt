t5 - meps test  m5 mouse. 
===================================

F21 in place, with heaped gel on top. Only do pressure measurements at the end, to minimize US saturation.

e141_dualsine_mep.py (with and without GNDing) - do I get a movement in either case? 
e141_ae_mep.py (can I get this working?) Have some thoughts on how to improve it. 

==============================

ensure to completely tape over the VEP electrode - don't add nail polish if I don't have to. 

1. continuity test. oops, it is the same mouse i put high pressures into on friday. This mouse was continuous... 

2. Consciousness monitoring. works best when both electrodes are in the brain.

2. AE MEP preparation. 

- Since the amplitude of dual meps is so small in this configuration, I can't really use it to test if everything is working. 

f21 in place
pv out = 0.4, vout = 6v.  g= 100. lp filter in place before preamp.

- I did an ae mep size vs frequency, and all the generated voltages looked pretty good. 


Can i do plain e mep? yes i can but my voltage output is 6v. 1hz. So I have a fairly high threshold, before I can see anything. 

My threshold for seeing anything is super huge. 5v just a bit... 
So if this is direct electrical stim, I am going to need something much bigger. 

= = = = = = = = = = = 

- So what i need to do is to use less voltage to obtain a bigger field gradient
This again points to needing a gradient field. 

- I also get all the secondary harmonics from applying a voltage with different size electrodes... and a massive electrochemical drift. 

What dominates is the DC offset... 

This may also have to do with how I am measuring it. 

1hr 49 minutes. Moved to warming chamber and given wet mash. 

Revising the files, they look amazingly great. The signals are generated correctly and i get about 150 microvolt amplitudes at 1Hz. The problem seems to be the non-linearity induced at high fields. I need 


- What's happening is that although I can generate a the difference frequency, I am generating a far larger DC offset in the mouse and this activity is what I am seeing, I think this is due to electrochemical interaction between cup electrode and the PtIR electrode. i would do better to have two closely positioned electrodes at the motor cortex to deliver the current, so I deliver less with fewer non-linear interactions due to electrode interface.
