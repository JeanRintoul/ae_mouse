t7 - ae meps test  m3 mouse. 
===================================

F21 is in place. The ae signal looks great. 


I use the low pass filter, and a tight filter on the preamp together to remove high frequency signals. 

- apply the stimulation through the cup electrode, i will need to use bonos thing in gnded mode. 
  use bonos current source. At what level does it become non-linear and surpass the charge injection limit? 
- How big can I get the acoustoelectric effect to be? 
- Do this at intervals, and see if the amplitude changes as the mouse comes out of anesthesia? 

- - -

- use bonos source at its highest output. 
- use visual cortex electrode as the stim electrode. 
- try to look for whisker movements instead of whole paw movements. 
- calibrate the position of the US using the AE effect itself. Is it bigger in any one direction? Measure with the cheek electrode and other head electrode... i.e. EMG.

==============================

gain = 200. 
vout  = 4  - if i go above this i get a weird non-linear effect in the preamp. 
df    = 1 hz
pout = 0.2 
filter 0.3 -> 1k

NOTE: in all recordings I deliberately filter out DC. 

calibrated position -

This time I have taped the cup electrode to the mouse arm. the other measurement electrode is the vep electrode.

v out , p out = 0.2, df 1Hz, redo these numbers as I messed up the gain calc but the data is good. 

4, 115 uv 
5, 151 uv 
6, 176 uv
7, 236 uv 
8, 256 uv 
9, 279 uv 
10, 305 uv 
11, 302 uv
12, 300 uv seem to be getting but more intermodulation or have hit cil? 

= = = = 

So now I am going up to the maximum using the voltage source... I get 300 microvolts with pout = 0.2 

= = = = 

pressure ramp. vout = 12, measurement electrode in visual cortex and on leg. 

p out
0.1   = 421 uv
0.2   = 712 uv 
0.3   = 1025 uv - larger DC shift. 
0.4   = 1291 uv - bigger DC shift. 
0.5   = 930 uv? not sure. 

It as if, the higher the pressure, the higher the ae effect, but ALSO, the higher the difference frequency. 

So I am showing a whole millivolt in amplitude at the difference frequency. This is a huge AE effect... but is it big enough to induce movement? It is barely big enough... The DC shift may be getting in the way - and certainly dominates at higher pressures. 

= = = = time series versus anesthesia. 

pout = 0.3, vout = 12 (which is 24v pp or the biggest I can go). I can only adjust the pressure from here. the files a labelled with the time since ketamine start. I get a beautiful and large acoustoelectric amplitude. It is clear - the F21 really helps reduce intermodulation. 

This is the biggest that I have made the acoustoelectric effect. 

Time:  Amplitude: 
= = = = = = = = = = 
62		930 uv 
65      1103 uv 
70      1032 uv
75      970 uv
80      1019 uv 
85 		1005 uv 
90 		1013 uv  (mouse jumped a bit right at the start)
93 		1000uv         (mouse moving)
95 		995 uv 
96		960 uv 

As soon as the pressure goes to 0.4 I get a physiological response. And it reflects the ultrasound DC offset. 

analyse t103 for emg. 

Right at the end I was getting a paw depression at p out = 0.3(w F21). So sensitivity WAS increased. However, it did not seem sensitive to the generated electric field, just the envelope of the pressure. 

- - - - 

Maybe the field I am generating, is not going through the right region? 

try higher gain for emg. I am not measuring EMG properly. 
What am I actually measuring there right now?
