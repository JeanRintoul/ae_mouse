t1 - mouse 
===============================================================================

This mouse was best at the start, and didnt really have much response at the end? 

- I have plugged the SR560 in, changed the EMG cables, and switched the bonotx to try to eliminate the noise. I will also use a cup electrode for stim in the mouth as it has a larger surface area, and copper tape as one of the EMG electrodes. 

EMG at gain = 200 all the way through. 

Attempt: 
AEDC loo test
AE loo test
Fswitch loo test

- all set up 15 minutes in. 
- i have changed the water in the utrasound, for whatever reason, this has diminished the DC offset I see in the applied pressure signal. 

ae1hz. 
1. - my first ae 1hz loo test, I still have noise on the EMG. 
   - when I remove the noise, the ae signal actually looks pretty good. 
   - the signal generated in the brain is good. 
2. voltage too high, mostly dc offset induce by the applied voltage in the EMG. 

k too deep at 43 minutes in. 

1hr 14 minutes, mouse starts twitching on application of fields. 

EMG gain is at 200, and still seems to work. 

Time to stop the test. 


1HR 35 MINS, 10:14AM INTO WARMING CHAMBER.
