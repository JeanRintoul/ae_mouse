ae1,2 with rf amplifier 

ae3 back to chained txs. 

The rf amplifier appears to be injecting far more current... I ovld at lower voltages with the rf amplifier, but not  when i usd the txs chained together. 

ae4 - chained txs, g500

removed the hw filter and try again? no good. 

ae5 - repeat - i simply cannot get the ae signal very large, even at max volts. So I am correct to use the RF amplifier... just realize... that I am injecting ALOT of current. 

ae6 - 12second duration to avoid filter start and end artefacts. 


The question is, should I wait until the mouse comes back into consciousness with this set up? Sure.. why not. 

Basically - I think my set up is fine. 

ae9 - changed filter to 100hz-1k to try to get rid of dc offset imposed by emg voltage even more. continued onwards with this setting. 

ae10 - mouse appears to be waking... 

Result: This is generally an ok set up, and I think the rf amplifier is too at low levels... however - i am not seeing any emg.
