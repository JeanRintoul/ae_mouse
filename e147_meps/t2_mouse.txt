Mouse M2 Note: 1 of the injections (k) didnt go into the body, it went through to the furr so I gave it a second dose. 
It is moving a lot. It never settled down, so I put lube on its eyes and moved it to the warming chamber and got some more mice from downstairs. 


M11 is taking a long time to slow down too. What am I doing wrong? It has been a short amount of time since there last dosing? 

I was successful last time with: 
- v=0.12, p=0.15 
I think I could add a bit more pressure. 

I am not measuring emg.. 

this mouse took a while but then entered deep anesthesia. Unfortunately, I was not able to calibrate the voltage and pressure level in time. I started with the same values I had successfully used in the previous mouse. 

This mouse however, responds differently to the voltage requiring much less. 

v = 0.07 
- What I need is a faster way to determine what voltage limit to use? 

The range tends to be so far: 
v0.07->0.12
p = 0.25 seems ok... 

- this mouse too was responsive first few exp minutes. 
- then, completely unresponsive. 
- however, I picked the wrong starting voltage... which meant I didnt get an initial result. 
- I am now waiting for when the mouse becomes responsive again. 
- Unless, i can use the first moments of an experiment to calibrate the required voltage and pressure... then just execute at the end when mouse comes online? 
- 
suddenly 1hr 24 min mouse online.

1hr 50 into warming chamber. 

- again - i am not picking up much emg at the end? front paw is moving... rear paw has emg electrode. 

The mouse is doing what you think it would, just not measuring EMG despite everything being plugged in correctly. 

- My verdict in general is that this experiment had a voltage non-linearity issue too low, meaning I couldnt get to sufficient amplitudes .
