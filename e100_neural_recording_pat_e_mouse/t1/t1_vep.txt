t1 - can i see a vep with pat's style electrodes? 
====================================================

Isoflurane? 

Set up updates: 
- New heat mat (Ideally has less noise?)
- I moved the RF channel to the differential input number 4. 
- I moved the whole neurator rig one breadboard spot to the left. 
- I am using Pat's electrode cable, with a mouse with that has this headbar attachment on it for the first time. 

Plug in using the plug and apply 4Hz LED. Can I see anything? 
- If so, try neural recording experiment. 

Two python files used: 
- ae_calibrate_with_ae.py 
- ae_demod_vep.py

Experiment start time: 12:52

Remember: double check signal cable, LED cable, and US cable positions to try to minimize interference. 

Cables are set ready for a straight VEP detection experiment. 

- Everything fit, it was a bit fiddly to plug in the cable but it worked. 
- It overloaded when I tried to go to 1000 gain. This may be due to high impedance? 
I then placed tape, and US gel. 

1. Obtain a VEP. Gain = 1000. Lights on in room. 
ae_demod_vep.py with pressure set to 0, LED frequency set to 4Hz. 

NOTE: I have giant heat mat noise... this limits the preamp range. When I turn off the heat mat, I can move the gain to 1000. I am going to have to toggle the heat mat on and off. 

Get at least one file with a clear VEP in it to continue. 

TODO: move the thermostar controller out of the faraday cage, so I can more easily turn it on and off, and also understand it as a noise source better. 

Honestly I cannot see the VEP. I don't think it is worth going further, unless I can see the VEP. 

Break, lets check the impedance. 

Note: my mini banana cable was totally broken.. this means I may not have measured anything. My bad. 

So the impedance between the electrodes seems quite good. Not the current problem. 
File 2. vpp = 1.768@8kHz, I = 0.379, z = 2.33kOhm. 
File 3. vpp = 1.79@2kHz  I = 0.344, z = 2.6kOhm. 
File 4. vpp = 1.622@500khz, I = 0.636, z = 1.27kOhm.  

Try VEPs again, but change the cable. My cable was broken... 

Mouse is breathing funny. Iso at 0.8. Irregular breathing. 

5. gain to 1000 with the heat mat off. 
I see large low f oscillation at 1.6hz. 

6. Add the GND wire back. 

I think I should finish this exp, recover the mouse. I see a large low f oscillation. 

Nothing really in terms of VEPs... I could see a dominate other low frequency oscillation.  
The good news was the mouse was easy to plug and unplug from the connector, and it fit well into the neurotar. 

1hr 29 min under iso, mouse woke up almost immediately after iso removal. 

What did I learn? 
The noise from the heat mat is a big problem. 
The cable to my preamp broke. 
It is unclear whether or not I can measure a VEP with this implant in the current state. 

The situation for the mouse seems much improved. 

TODO: Is the heat mat noise issue due to the heat mat, or the probe itself? 

Use gain and then test - icannot see the heat mat noise now. 


I can use the other mouse tomorrow. The one with two wires. It appears reasonable in quality. I will need to also use the silver wire.
