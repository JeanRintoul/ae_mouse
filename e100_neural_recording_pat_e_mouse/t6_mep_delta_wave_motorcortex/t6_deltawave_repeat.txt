t6 - meps 
================================================

27g female, with two electrodes in the motor cortex. Never been used before. 

drugs:
antidote:5.2
X:1.3
k1:2.6
k2:1.0
saline: 50

Plan: 
- reapply nail polish to mouse. 9 minutes in nail polish applied. 
- calibrate position roughly. Do I get a larger amplitude sum frequency? 
- run aedelta_demod.py with continuous wave. 
- Can I do it with the noisy heat mat? I think this keeps the mouse warmer. 
- If I have time, try demod at a few different pressures. 

== start 10:40 am. 12/7/2023

Note: this mouse has a little cement sticking out the side, that means it only fits into headbar at an angle. 

Wait 5 minutes for nail polish to dry. 

z = 4.8k at 8khz 
rough calibration complete, using 1V, 8kHz. I am getting much higher values than yesterday than I was with 2v applied. This may be due to higher current density in this arrangement of electrodes? 

Plug electrodes into preamp. gain = 1000. 

2. aedelta_demod.py pressure voltage out = 0.08V, I see what looks like some DC offset in data. I see the heat mat noise.  turned off heat mat. 

3. repeat of v out = 0.08

4-5. v out = 0.1v 

6-7. ae_calibrate_with_ae_PRF1k, 1020 

HERE HERE START HERE! 
- start analysis here. suddenly the sum f turned on. Weird! first mouse use, 42 mins into ket/xyl. 

8-9. vout = 0.1 aedelta_demod suddenly a giant DC offset. ANALYZE these ones! Suddenly the sum f is huge! 

10. p vout = 0.15 aedelta_demod note: i got an ovld. 

11-12. p vout = 0.05 aedelta_demod

13-14. p v out = 0.02 aedelta_demod 

15-16 p out = 0.08v aedelta_demod  - it stopped doing the mixing thing? 

One more PRF1k. 8seconds. Can I demod with the PRF? 
17-18 aedelta demod. 
v out = 0.1v

19-20. continuous wave comparison of aedelta_demod, p v out = 0.1v. 
   19 and 20 went outside the range due to giant DC offset. 

21  p vout = 0.08
22  p vout = 0.08 

heat mat was off for all this time? it was cold and that induced f mixing?

- - MEPS - - 

- put electrodes onto left forepaw and tail. 
- leave preamp hooked up to brain. 
- change daq range to 0.2 recompile. 

put rf amp input onto fg1. 

23. aemeps_dual_acoustic_waveform, i can see a mixing frequency in the neurons, but it is possible that the mouse is too deep in the k-hole. 

i set up the camera, and the LED as well. Each time I do this, the neural DF data looks awesome, having a good amplitude of the df freuquemcy. However, my mouse is not moving, not even twitching. 1hr 26 minutes in. 

24. mb a little something, df = 2hz

25. it was in the neural data, but only 50 microvolts. that isn
t enough. 

26. turn off the heat mat at 12:15. dfx = 2 
100 microvolts neural amplitude at 12:20
turn heat mat back on. 

27. heat mat back on. 
neural amplitude at 12:25 is 100 microvolts

28 it worked! but i didnt viddy it. 

29 vid 1. 12:46 i 2hz df. 

30. vid 2 df = 1 great! notably my EMG electrode are not good. 

31. vid 3 df = 3 great

32. vid 4 df = 4 

33. vid 5 df = 3 

34. vid 6 df = 2 

35. vid 6 df = 1 

36 vid 7 df = DC 

37 vid 8 df = DC 

38 acoustic ramp. 

39 acoustic ramp 2

40. Vary the pressure. aemeps_dual_acoustic_waveform.py fuck I oover road 37
   p out = 0

mouse woke up started moving too much. 
2hrs 30 mins to warming chamber.
