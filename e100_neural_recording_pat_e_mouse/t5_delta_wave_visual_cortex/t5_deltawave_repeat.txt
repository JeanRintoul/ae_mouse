t5 - delta wave neural decoding 
================================================
23.6g female mouse with Pat style head bar. Cage 115198 (surgery 27.6.23)
- 23.6g inclusive of headbar. It has lost weight... It used to be 26g. 
- I think last time, maybe it got cold? I was using the chemical heater only, and this is a very small adult female mouse. 

drugs:
antidote:4.2
X:1.1
k1:2.2
k2:1.0
saline: 50

Plan: 
- calibrate position roughly. Do I get a larger amplitude sum frequency? 
- run aedelta_demod.py with continuous wave. 
- Can I do it with the noisy heat mat? I think this keeps the mouse warmer. 
- If I have time, try demod at a few different pressures. 

= = =

Experiment Plan: 
- Can I see a delta wave after K-administration?
- When running calibration position, obtain the impedance. 
- what is the amplitude of the carrier frequency? Does it seem like it is being magnified by mouse? 
- run ae_calibrate_with_ae_PRF1k.py  what is the amplitude at 1020Hz? is it above 100 microvolts?
- try a few different pressures. Is there a pressure that works better?

start: 12:33 am 

1. there appears to be a delta wave. Also heat mat noise but Im going to try ignoring it. 

2. ae calibrate with ae. no US or gel. 8kohm impedance = 5.3kohm. 

Set up US. 4kohm impoedance at 8khz
3. 

Switch to preamp. 
4. ae_calibrate_with ae PRF1k. 

gain = 500. P out = 0.1 (1MPa) running aedelta_demod.py
5. aedelta_demod.py  notably, it railed toward the end where DC offset is big. I need to go down to 500 gain. 

6. repeat 

7. gain = 500. P out = 0.05v 400kPa. The signal looks less distorted as raw data. 

8. gain = 500. P out = 0.05v 400kPa. I cannot see the demod signal at all. 

9. gain = 500. P out = 0.02v 400kPa. 

10. gain = 500. P out = 0.02v 400kPa. 

11. gain = 500. P out = 0.0v 0kPa. clear delta waves + heat mat noise

12. gain = 500. P out = 0.0v 0kPa. clear delta waves + heat mat noise

Turn off heat mat, perhaps heat mat is getting in the way of demod? 
   
13. gain = 500. P out = 0.08v 0kPa. no heat mat. 

14. gain = 500. P out = 0.08v 0kPa. no heat mat. 

I am not getting it... try moving the transducer around. 
heat mat on. 

15. 0,0 test. 

16. wait, the demod fft sorta matches. moved 0.39mm ml right. 

17-20. move down dv by..? 0.5 , p =0.08, gain = 500. Analyze these ones. Did I miss something in my script? 

21-22. PRF 1020 

Move the US around some more. Go back to continuous wave. 
23-24, position 0,0.3

In none of my measures i am getting DC offset. why not? 
XY
25 (1.0) 

26 (1,0.5)

27. (1,1)

28. (0,1)

29. (0,0)

30. (0,-1)

31. down another 0.5 , mouse is starting to wake up 1hr 35 minutes in. 

32. (0,0) why do I not see a DC offset in these recordings when US is applied? 
 
go back to calibration. 

33. calibrate with ae. I saw the tail go up. I can see NO AE effect here. 

1hr 45 min finish, antidote and move mouse to warming chamber. END.
