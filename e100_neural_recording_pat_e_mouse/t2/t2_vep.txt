t2 - can I see a VEP with implanted electrodes in recovery mouse?
====================================================

Result: On analysis, there was pretty much no VEP. I do not know why. 
It's possible that the VEP electrode wasn't that well connected? 

Isoflurane? 
Mouse with implanted electrodes that go INTO brain. 

Two python files used: 
- ae_calibrate_with_ae.py 
- ae_demod_vep.py 

Let's try this using a different temp probe. 

Note: I put tape over the other reference electrode, and at the back of the headbar, so ideally only the one VEP electrode is acoustically exposed.

Experiment start time: 10:04am.


Basic VEP test: 
Lights off overhead. Iso 1.2
1. I think I am getting a VEP. 

Apply US. 
Calibrate US position using ae_calibrate_with_ae.py 

2. Location roughly calibrated to electrode

Plug back into PREAMP. I have a 0.1Hz high pass filter. 1Mhz low pass. 
still overloads. Gain down to 500. No longer overloads. 
8 second duration. 

Question: is the thermo mat noise or the RF amp noise bigger?
LED frequency 4Hz. 
Acoustically Connected.
Starting VEP tests: 
3 - 5
heat mat off
6-9 
heat mat back on. 
during this time a perioding low f thing came into the waveform in two files. 
I think this is induced when the mouse is not in thermal equilibrium. 
Wait a couple of minutes. Iso to 0.8? Freezer off. 
10-20
VEP test summary: files 3 - 23

Put a little more eye lube. 
7Hz LED Flash, acoustically connected. A periodic 10Hz signal appeared that is quite large. I do not know what it is. 
Stop I have very little O2. Cannot do more unless I sacrifice obtaining a control. 
### PRF TESTS
Acoustically connected.
30. PRF 1020
31. PRF 1020

### NO ACOUSTIC CONNECTION 
32. PRF 1020
33. PRF 1020

No acoustic connection. Otherwise same voltages and other parameters. US is in position, with wires in same places. 
NO ACOUSTIC CONNECTION 
ae_demod_vep.py 
4Hz 34-54. 

There seems to be some weird periodic signals in the final few files. They may be from the mouse as they are low frequency. 

Should I do any 7Hz control? Nah. 

= = = = = = 
Note: all measurements here are pure differential measurement(to try to reduce common mode noise).

END and recover mouse. 
Time: 2 hrs  12:04pm. 

Note: there was heat mat noise all the way through this, but I can still see the VEP underneath. 

Note: the VEP electrode wire didnt seem all that well connected. 

Change over the 02.
