t3 - can I see a VEP with pat style electrode recovery mouse?
====================================================
25 g female mouse. 
antidote - 4.8
x:1.2
k1:2.5
k2 :1

Experiment additions. 
- new heat mat with chemical heater. It seems not as hot, but warm... maybe ok?
- new cable from Jon straight to BNC. 
I am using the Pat electrode implant. 

- one eye looks bulgy, it is the VEP eye. I cannot see a VEP. 

I put tape over the other electrode, to ensure no connection. also over back of headbar. Thus there should be no gel connection at all between the measurement and reference. 

= = = = = = = = = = = 
start time: 10:30am 

1. ae_demod_vep, led freq = 4hz. 
   I seem to see a periodic, LED activated something, but it isn't at 4hz. 
   2.9Hz? 

2. LED at 7hz nothing. 
What I am getting is a reliable 2.99 and 6Hz. It doesn't seem to matter if I have LED or not. What I could do, is try demodulating this? 
Turning off the LED. still get the k- wave. 

Impedance 2.6k
Note: I am differentially connected with no 

I am going to try demodulating the k wave
roughly calibrated and start collecting data: 35 minutes in. 

preamp set to 0.1Hz ->1MHz filter. 

Remember to turn on the preamp! 
I adjusted the range to 20v as I seem to be saturating at the output due to the big DC offsets. 

Pressure = 1MPa. Gain = 1000. 
Acoustically connected: 
2-21. 
Frequency of k-wave is: 1.7,3.4,6.7. It is big amplitude. Let's go with it.  
20 files with the k-wave and US. 

at file 14, the amplitude of k-wave is diminishing. Something is changing. The temp probe thinks it is at 45 degrees but this seems wrong? 

Not acoustically connected: 20 files. 
22-42. 


1hr 35 minutes, delivered antidote, and moved to warming chamber. 

the mouse felt warm, the chemical warmer is still delivering heat.

delta slow waves are huge, and reliable under ketamine...
