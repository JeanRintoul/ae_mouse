t7 - dual wave demodulation 
================================================

ketamin/xylazine delta wave demodulation. 

24.2g female mouse, one electrode over visual cortex, the other over the motor cortex. 

drugs:
antidote:4.8
X:1.2
k1:2.4
k2:1.0
saline: 50

- use a 500khz and 510khz signal super imposed, such that the demodulation is done around 10khz. 
- change my preamp filter to remove the 500khz. 


= = = = = = = = 
Start: 1:30pm

2. 2.6kohm impedance at 8k
ae_calibrate position i get a max of 5 microvolts. it is pretty low. 

3. aedelta_demod with no pressure and connected to the preamp at 1000 gain. 
Can I see a delta wave? NO. 
Is my mouse breathing? NO. 
I think my mouse died.
