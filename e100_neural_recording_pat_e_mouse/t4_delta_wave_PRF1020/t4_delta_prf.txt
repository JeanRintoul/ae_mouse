t4 - delta wave neural decoding and MEP test.
================================================

Results summary: The neural decoding flat out didn't work for any of them. I think there is a positioning issue which could be fixed with the 672.8kHz transducer. 

33 g male mouse. Not with Pat's implant. 

antidote - 4.8
x:1.2
k1:2.5
k2 :1

- use a chemical heater. 
- this mouse has a poor VEP now long after implant. The k wave is strong. Use it. 

I put tape over the other electrode, to ensure no connection. also over back of headbar. Thus there should be no gel connection at all between the measurement and reference. 

= = = = = = = = = = = 

Plan: 
- set mouse up, administer ketamine/xylazine. 
- run ae_demod_vep.py with no pressure. Can I see the Ket/Xyl induced delta waves? 
- If I can see delta waves, position the transducer using, ae_calibrate_with_ae.py such that the transducer is positioned over the MEP electrode. 

- run ae_demod_VEP.py with continuous wave. 
- run ae_demod_PRF.py with PRF 1020 4 times. 

- start setting up MEP experiment. Use the side LED. Set up cup electrodes. 
- Put one electrode on the tail, the other electrode on the forepaw? Set gain to 100 on preamp. Recording will come through on ch 0. 

- run continuous MEP test, and the dual sine wave one. 
1. ae_test.py . Do I see or measure any EMG?
2. ae_dual_acoustic_waveform.py remember to switch the function generator outputs over for this. This should be a 4Hz wave output. Do I see or measure any EMG? 


= = = = = = = = = = = 

start time: 12:30am. 
1. ae_demod_vep with no pressure or current. gain = 1000, I can see some signal. I am at the MEP electrode. I can see some low f waves. go with it. 

z = 4kohm at 8khz.
5 microvolts df peak.. fairly low at 8khz 

gain set to 1000, measuring on ch 0. 0.1Hz-1MHz and pressure wave 1MPa. continuous wave. 
2-5 continuous waves at 500khz. 

switch to PRF 1020. ae_demod_PRF.py , file 14 has a super nice signal in it. 
6-15. I saw a little movement at onset of US in file 15. 

PRF 120. The ketamine wave is strong. 
16-20. 

Note: I still see the up and down scaline of the acoustic waveform. 
this may be an aliasing thing? 

- MEPS, set up now with heat mat? 

21. gain 100, ae_test.py . The raw data is dominated by the US waveform, even when measured t the hind leg and tail. 
whiskers moving at 1hr 11 min. 
I can see nothing in terms of beat frequency. 
22.


Dual acoustic waveform. switch the the other fg. 4 s
23. 

26. move to 8 seconds. the filtered data has something. 

27. mb? 

28.  mb at the start - took video. video is also larger at the start. 

29. i got a 2hz movement. i took video. 1.55pm 

30. again with the 2hz. 8 second time overall. i got movement again. 1.57pm viddfy.

31. df = 1 Hz. 1:58 vi

32. df = 1Hz 2pm. 

33. df = 3Hz 

34. df = 3 

35. df = 2 

36. df = 2 

37 continuous. 4 s

Note: I was not sufficiently heating the mouse for the MEP section, heat mat was off. 

I need to clean up the ae_dual_acoustic waveform_code so it shows me what I want in plots. 

My EMG connections were not great... make it better. 
Analse this data. 

1hr 45 minutes duration. 

Mouse moved to warming chamber. 


TODO: make another cup electrode with male end.
