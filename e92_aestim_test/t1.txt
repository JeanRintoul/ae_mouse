ae stim test. 
===============  

mouse 33.5g. New style surgery first test with headbar. 

New MEP mouse with updated protocol. Is the headbar super awesome, or does it leave something to be desired? 

2.5 ket
1.5xyl
6 antisedan
reup dose: 1 tick ket

10:30am. 
In this mouse, the cement underneath, sticks out to far so that inhinbits headbar usage. 

Question: is the mouth area near the right forepaw area? 

Overview: 
Cup electrode with stim gel in mouth as reference. 
MEP electrode in forepaw position. 
run ae_calibrate_with_ae.py for the whole experiment. 

- run ae_calibrate_with_ae.py to localize the position of the US transducer around the MEP electrode. This can be done when the mouse is under deeper anaesthesia. 
   v out = 2V. 
- do the AE test with AE calibrate, at e field of 499.998 kHz. 
  Where do I get the best amplitude? Does the position of the cup electrode reference matter? 
- Artefact Test: With acoustic connection, and without acoustic connection. 
- What amplitude would I expect to see a response? 
  - It depends what the minimum amplitude is that I can see a response with e stim? 
  - what happens if I do a prolonged e stim at 500khz? 
  - what happens if I do a prolonged US stim at 500khz?

2v out, 70hz. I can see mouth clench. 
2v out 499995, i get no mouth clench. no direct recruitment. 
So I can turn up the current at higher frequencies. 
Having trouble seeing the df when the applied frequency is high. This may be due to the time length of recording. 
At ef high, the sum f is much larger than the df. This may be due to measurement issue, of having not enough reps in FFT? 
Moving to 8 second stim time seems to help with fft resolution and difference between sf and df. 
I think calibration is going to be really important in getting this to work. 

Lets go down some. Go up 0.5. Wasnt as good. 
Going up was ok, only repeated once. 

Previously at 30hz dF. 

Minimum v to get whisker response. 1 volt as it is waking. 
1hr 48 mins, mouse is starting to wake. 

1. 'current_amplitude': 6,   #  its actually a voltage .. Volts. 
'current_frequency': 499996,  # 

2. reasonable sizes something? around 20hz?what is that. noithing visible at 4 hz

3.4. cannot see anything at the df when down low... do this in saline
'pressure_amplitude': 0.1,  # how much is lost through skull??? 400kPa, 0.08 is about 200kPz. 0.15 is about 400kPa. 
'pressure_frequency': 500000.0,
'current_amplitude': 12,   #  its actually a voltage .. Volts. 
'current_frequency': 499996,  # 

why on earth am i getting a peak at 20hz?

TODO: do dF in saline.

Caliobration is hard. 
Getting the right stim spot is hard. 
TODO: I seem to be getting more whisker/jaw movements than paw. CHeck out my coords
Better head bar setting up. 

Finished 2hrs. 

mouse in warming chamber.
