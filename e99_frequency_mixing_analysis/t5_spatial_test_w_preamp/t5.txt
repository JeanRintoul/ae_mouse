t5 - spatial test with preamp, and pats electrodes as phantom. 
=============================================================== 

- preamp
- rf monitor plugged into ch 4. 
I cannot do this with the preamp, unless I have separate charge injection and measure electrodes... 

TO do the ultrasound measurements, I need low noise environment as the signal can't be made bigger... 


- so find the focus using the v measurement system. Once I've found it, switch over to the preamp. DONE! 


1. I am roughly on focus using 8kHz to find the focus. calibrate_ae... 
2. run ae_calibrate_with_ae_PRF1k.py


This time I am assessing amplitude through filtering instead... it is lower, but seems more dependable. 

The amplitude of thd df and sf is scaling with the carrier frequency amplitude. 

- - 
It is scaling with the EM magnitude, and not the actual pressure. 
Whereas, the AE field scales with the pressure. 


3. acoustically connected. PRF 1k 
4. not acoustically connected. The sf and df are still there, they are just smaller in amplitude. 

Hence, this data is interesting but suggests the AE effect is a separate entity from this EM interference. 

This is not bad, but it blows away my AE  and US neuromodulation are the same thing idea.
