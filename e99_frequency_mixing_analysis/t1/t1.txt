t1 - Does the PRF 1kHz vary amplitude to follow the focus or not? 
====================================================

- ae_calibrate_with_ae_PRF1k
- first find the focus with 8k. 

- Interestingly, I am getting a highly variant amplitude right now. 
Switch to the other single monopolar set up. This is because it is bipolar so over a larger area. 

- switching to the other set up. The monopolar set up is 100 times better for measuring calibration data.... NOTE WELL!!! 


This means I should redo the DC, 1MHz calibration data as well as do a PRF data calibration. 

At the calibrated focal point where I know the AE signal is highest, I am not seeing 1khz prf. 

Set daq range to 0.2V
- File 1. Very interesting looks like there is modulation around 1Mhz... PRF file
- File 2  Continuous wave file.. 

In saline, I am not getting clear mixing as I thought I had before. Was I only getting that in the mouse? 

There seems to be a small offset in the DF, then at the SF there seems to be split on either side of it. I've seen this before... 

There does not appear to be frequency mixing happening like what I had before. I am not sure that i have done this in saline. 
TODO: check back - have I done PRF 1kHz in saline? 

What I do see is the mains harmonics, and that they appear to be innaccurately mixed around 1MHz... there is some sort of sampling offset here which gives a 30Hz spectral difference.

RESULT SUMMARY: 
FOR POSITION CALIBRATION, I SHOULD ONLY USE THE MONOPOLAR IMPEDANCE SYSTEM. 
- I AM NOT SEEING FREQUENCY MIXING IN THE MEDIUM at DC, 1MHz, 1kHz PRF etc. 
- In the past I had thought I had seen frequency mixing here. Was it only in the mouse or did I have it also in saline?

Both in saline. 
file 1. shows the PRF file (1kHz Pout = 0.1V)
file 2. shows a typical DC file (P out = 0.1V)
NO MIXING IS OCCURING with just the ultrasound being applied
