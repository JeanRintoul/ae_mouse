t1 - Mouse. Do I see mixing frequencies due to US. 
====================================================

- I could move the stereotax arm over one notch so the big US doesn't hit it. 
  Or alternatively move the mouse holder area? that would really be easier. 
  
- It is going to be key to ensure that the wires do not short with each other... 

Isoflurane. 

- ae_calibrate_with_ae_PRF1k
- first find the focus with 8k. 

Use the set up with monopolar claibration, and my EEG mouse do find the focus. 

10:09am
- Impedance measurement. 
  6k at 2kHz
  5kohm at 8kHz. 
  1.7k at 500kHz. 
Seems acceptable.
Add tape to the back of head, so I don't short the wires together. 

Putting the US gel on, I go down to 2.8k impedance at 8kHz. 

Now calibrate with 8kHz, 2V signal. 
Notably, the AE magnitude is much much smaller with this PT wire pt electrode.

I get to 14 microvolts in amplitude, and say good enough with v out = 2v. 

Now I have approximately found the focus, I change Daq range to 0.2V and recompile. 


I try ae_calibrate_with_PRF 1k.. it appears lost in the noise, similar to my last saline measurement. 
answer, i am outputting the wrong thing through the rf amplifier, so I was also applying nothing in saline.

- try moving duration to 8 seconds. amplitude to 0.11v. 

Now try changing the pressure. 
PRF 1kHz. 

I can use the below files to get the RF amplifier data out from ch

Spatial location testing with the sf for 1MHz script, as this appears the largest and easiest to see. 

Some jerking motion occurred when i moved it. 
the DC measure is contaminated with noise, but the sf might be ok.

I am not confident the spatial test is a good one, as there is no current source exactly to map. 

Finally, lets to with and without acoustic connection. 

With acoustic connection.

29.     0.1     4.0   1.69  130    i CANT BE CLEAR THAT THE DF ISNT A HARMONIC OF MAINS? CHECK. 
 
I seem to be getting some sort of frequency offset too? 

Without acoustic connection.

33.     0.1    23   3.05  225

So some proportion is EM noise(likely due to my silver wires being antennae). Some proportion is not EM noise. 

END. 2hrs 32 minutes, note its left eye(VEP eye) seems to have no lubricant on it. It may be blind... unknown. 

TODO: 
Check whether the DC offset is larger when I run PRF code vs 1MHz code? It looks like it may be. 
ALSO CHECK THE dc OFFSET BETWEEN ACOUSTICALLY CONNECTED AND NOT.
