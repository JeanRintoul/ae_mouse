t4  - point and plate for higher current density. 
====================================================


black on point electrode 4v, 8khz 1MPa 3.66 mA. 780 ohms. 

red on point electrode 213 microvlts

I get a similar value either way the electrodes are positioned 

Being closer together, the results do seem larger. 


# Now with larger values with Pt and large surface area plate... 
which are also closer together do the 

(changed daq range to 0.2V)


1. ae_calibrate with ae DC 8 second duration
   33.5 microvolts. at sum and difference. 
   31 microvolts. 
   18 and 32 microcolts. 
2-4.    16.8 and 33 microvolts. 

5-9 ae_calibrate_with_ae_PRF1k.py (far more visible at sum and difference frequencies. )
   (still the s and diff is biforcated)
   Note: there is also a DC offset. 

   How does the DC offset in ae PRF1k change with pressure? 
   Note the carrier and DC offsets are offset due to biforcated carrier frequency? 

These files all have reasonably large amplitude signals. So would be good to look at/filter etc.

(Note I think 13 is mains harmonics)

TO ADD: Another proof point of mixing, is if the 1k is larger than the 2k spike?
