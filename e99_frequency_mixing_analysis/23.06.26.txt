Monday: LED addition, saline test, long chat with Nir. 
Tuesday: Mouse Surgeries
Wednesday: DRI Monthly meeting and saline tests. 
Thursday: More saline tests and a mouse tests on US only. 
Friday: Last check on mice, equipment movement adjustment, short wire and plate saline test, home and to do analysis. 

Where am I really? 

- My surgery for a long time involved shorted electrodes... no good for demodulation. I was measuring the AE effect between the screws. GAH. 

- I have completed a new set of mouse surgeries which should allow me to test:
  - demodulation
  - AE amplitudes in vivo and surface area saline test. 
  - MEPs
Ideally in a way which is reusable and doesn't hurt the mouse. 


Neural Recording: 
- repeat neural recording with artefact test with both 500kHz and 672.8kHz transducer. 
- Do this in the dark. 
- Use positioning calibration, and also consider using Ket/Xyl for larger VEP amplitudes. 

AE Amplitude tests in saline:
 - with point electrode and square electrode. How does surface area effect the amplitudes? 

MEPS: 
- I need to do some saline tests do acquire the difference frequency better. 
- How do I get rid of the DC offset? Does having electrode out of acoustic field help?
- What else should I do? Can I run just the current function generator at a higher Fs? 

Ultrasound Neuromodulation Mechanism: 
- Do a series of proofpoints. 
Observations so far: 
   - I see in US neuromodulation sum and difference frequencies (harmonics) in electric field. 
   - I also see this when I generate a PRF similar to US neuromodulation.

US Neuromodulation proof points: 
Note: Do all the saline tests first. 

1 Amplitude covariance scale test
  a. Saline : The carrier frequency amplitude scales with the applied pressure, but do the sum and difference frequencies? Try for both continuous wave, and PRF 1000. 
  b. Mouse: if saline test is both true, try this in a mouse. 

2 Spatial Location Test
  a. saline: try spatial location test with PRF = 1000. 
  b. Mouse: Try the PRF 1kHz, or DC and 1MHz spatial location test. Are these frequencies visible only at the focus? Is it different to saline? 

THIS IS NOT A GOOD TEST, AS THERE IS NO REAL CURRENT SOURCE TO MAP IN THIS ARTIFICIAL CASE. 

3 Coordinated RF amplifier confound test. 
  With both continuous and PRF, do I have info in the RF amplifier monitor that confounds anything? 

4 With and without acoustic connection test. Could it be due to EM noise from the US? 
  a. saline: do a comparative test with and without acoustic connection. Do I see the mixing frequencies in either continuous or PRF ultrasound when acoustically disconnected? 
  b. repeat in mouse. 

Later questions: 
- What is the mechanism of this mixing by the carrier frequency? 
- Is there an amplification of the AE signal, or an applied DC signal in the mouse? 
- How can I show this? I need similar surface area electrodes. 	
- Does the amplitude of the carrier diminish over time of anesthesia? 
- Is the amplitude of these effects sufficient to induce a neural signal?

Saline surface area tests? 
Do surface area tests in saline with PtIr square electrodes and point electrodes. 
What is the amplitude difference between the two for the AE effect? 

-----

Should I do a new surgery? MEP or EEG mouse with Pat's style electrodes?
