t3 - ae neural recording. Try to do a side to side test with M3 mouse. 
=======================================

I missed the side to side test, so I am trying to do it again here so that mouse m3 has a full data set that is usable. 

= = 

Attempt at a full test.  

VEP at 10Hz
Calibration

4 tests:
1. frequency specificity test 8Hz and 10Hz VEP with US at 1MPa. v out = 0.1. 10x repeats of each. 30 seconds duration of each. 
2. side to side test, and attempt at spatial map based on 10Hz VEP. 
3. Acoustically connected vs not. (this should just be the not, as 1. is the connected part)

4. Two-tone test: to prove f mixing not occuring in the preamp. Remove the US, place electrodes such that the measurement electrodes and stim electrodes are at 3 separate levels.

==============================

1. VEP test at 10Hz, Iso at 0.6. 10 microvolts p-p. larger at 20 hz. 

2. side test 3Hz-1MHz band pass. gain = 2000.  iso = 0.5. Heat mat has noise. Turned off heat mat after first measurement. Its also possible Xiaoqi's light adds noise? 

END: 
Mouse into warming chamber. 
Given wet mash on recovery. 

1hr under isoflurane.
