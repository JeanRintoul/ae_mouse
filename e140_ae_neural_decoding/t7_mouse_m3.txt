t7 - ae neural recording. 
===================================

M3, repeat side test and try a spatial test. Is the acoustoelectric measurement spatially specific? 

Attempt at a full test.  

VEP at 10Hz
Spatial Calibration

3 tests:
1. frequency specificity 10Hz ae VEP with US at 1MPa. v out = 0.1. 20x repeats of each. 30 seconds duration of each. 
2. side to side test, and attempt at spatial map based on 10Hz VEP. 
3. Acoustically connected vs not. (this should just be the not, as 1. is the connected part)
4. spatial map.

=============================================

1. straight to ae calibrate. iso = 1.0. calibration was small amplitude but reliable and repeatable. 

2. ae neural recording 10Hz. 43 minutes in, iso = 0.5. giant heat mat noise. 
   turned off heat mat. I have a VEP but I am not seeing modulation. Perhaps the position is wrong? 

3. Try doing a spatial map. 8hz vep, looking at the 16Hz peak as that is largest in the VEP. I couldnt really see anything from a single measurement at any point. 

Even with 10 recordings i am not seeing anything. 

stop. completely unsuccessful. I can't make a map if I can't see the modulation. 

Sometimes there was more or less noise around the 500khz.
