t1 - ae neural recording. 
===================================

Attempt at a full test.  

VEP at 10Hz
Calibration

4 tests:
1. frequency specificity test 8Hz and 10Hz VEP with US at 1MPa. v out = 0.1. 10x repeats of each. 30 seconds duration of each. 
2. side to side test, and attempt at spatial map based on 10Hz VEP. 
3. Acoustically connected vs not. (this should just be the not, as 1. is the connected part)

4. Two-tone test: to prove f mixing not occuring in the preamp. Remove the US, place electrodes such that the measurement electrodes and stim electrodes are at 3 separate levels.

==============================

Note: There is a bit of dry skin/redness on top of the eyes. 

1. VEP test at 10Hz, Iso at 0.8. 10 microvolts VEP, 10 p-p. visible at 10hz,20 and 30 Hz. 20Hz is the biggest peak 1t 16.5 microvolts, about 40 pp. Mouse has a great VEP. 

2. Calibrate the ultrasound position. The cone must be very crooked. I am getting a very small acoustoelectric calibration signal this time. 2.x microvolts. gain 200. At the point of maxima, which did seem repeatable and reliable, I stopped. I removed the wires. 

3. ae neural recording at 10hz. Iso = 0.8, pressure = 0.1. 
   First try - noise.  Turning off the heat mat didnt make a difference. Turning the heat mat off at the power DID make a difference... and the noise went away. 

   1hr 20. Iso = 0.75m 10 x recordings. No VEP yet. ISO at 0.6. 
   I had to wait some time, for the iso to lighten and see a VEP. 
   1hr 40 I see a VEP. 
   In the 10 files, do I see the modulated signal? Do I see a VEP? No VEP. 
   I turn the heat mat back on, and the VEP started to re-appear. 
   Will the noise cancel out through averaging? 

   8 Hz ae vep, pressure up to 0.1, iso = 0.5. 

   I am just getting no VEP. The mouse IS alive, breathing is slow but steady... not like ISO is at 0.5. 

   ISO = 0.2 
   Mouse is metabolizing iso differently somehow... it is still under at ISO =0.2. 
   2hr 18 mins. 
   started moving eventually - iso back up to 0.5. Overhead light is off, but Xiaoqi light is on. 

   8hz ae vep, iso = 0.5. I got a VEP this time.. but couldnt see the modulated signal. Maybe too much noise. I turned off the heat mat ready for another attempt at 10Hz vep. 

   10Hz VEP attempt. heat mat off. iso = 0.5, p = 0.12v mouse moving a very tiny amount, very occasionally. I can see it... small but there. 15 recordings. 

   8hz ae vep; iso = 0.5, p = 0.12v. Got it! 

 - Not acoustically connected test. 20 times? Same LED, and signal into transducer. Transducer is lifted up above the gel so there is a small air gap. 

New information: I need more than 10 reps to see it clearly. Do 20 reps. 

NOTE: 
This mouse seems very sensitive to ISO... a little goes a long way. 

TODO: 

4 hrs and 28 mins. 14:52 into warming chamber. 


With the ac conn test... clearly the 500kHz e signal is gone... 
So in this way, the side to side test IS better....
