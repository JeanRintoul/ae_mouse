t4 - ae neural recording. 
===================================

M4, vertical headbar, first use. 


Attempt at a full test.  

VEP at 10Hz
Spatial Calibration

3 tests:
1. frequency specificity test 8Hz and 10Hz VEP with US at 1MPa. v out = 0.1. 10x repeats of each. 30 seconds duration of each. 
2. side to side test, and attempt at spatial map based on 10Hz VEP. 
3. Acoustically connected vs not. (this should just be the not, as 1. is the connected part)

==============================
NOTE: I only have 50 left of 02 - keep an eye on it. 

1. 10Hz VEP, ISO = 0.7. 25 microvolt p-p... with lights on.. smaller at 20 and 30 looks great. 

2. Instead of calibration, consider just going straight to the spatial map code. 

3. The signal looks sort of weird... it is possible I have a non-ideal connection. The VEP looked good though? The VEP is gone now mouse has been under iso longer. 

I do a regular calibration, replace tape.. still the signal looks weird. 

ae neural recording. 
8hz aevep - I didnt get it, but instead got some large deviation... maybe i need to remove a file? I think somehow I am positioned in the wrong location? 

absolutely nothing. The signal looks really weird... 

I think I should stop, fix the signal. 


I then tried the US again, without the mouse... in a phantom and the signal looked normal. Hence I think the signal issue is related to the implant electrodes. Perhaps there is a d/c? 

Suggestion for after lunch - try mouse m5. Is it the vertical electrode style, or is it something else?
