t4 - ae neural recording. 
===================================

M5, vertical headbar, first use. 

Attempt at a full test.  

VEP at 10Hz
Spatial Calibration

3 tests:
1. frequency specificity test 8Hz and 10Hz VEP with US at 1MPa. v out = 0.1. 10x repeats of each. 30 seconds duration of each. 
2. side to side test, and attempt at spatial map based on 10Hz VEP. 
3. Acoustically connected vs not. (this should just be the not, as 1. is the connected part)

=============================================
NOTE: I only have 40 left of 02 - keep an eye on it. 

Everything fit together, I had to press quite hard to get the plug in. Maybe I didn't do this correctly before in M4? 

1. 10Hz VEP, ISO = 0.7. 25 microvolts. 

2. When I apply US, do I see a constant good signal? I do in calibration. 

3. ae neural recording: preamp 1hz-1Mhz bandpass. iso = 0.5 
	8hz ae vep:  30 seconds. Do I see the US signal properly, or does it look weird? It looks correct. At least this mouse is connected properly.  1-11 files have nothing in them. vep too small. 
	file 12 got it... I just needed a larger vep amplitude -> lower iso. 

	the vep has gone... in the first few files. 

	10hz ae vep:  got it.. but there is some extra noise in there. Maybe post analysis can help.  

	It is possible I am inducing a movement from the US? It sure looks like it. Each time I apply a continuous wave the paws outstretch as does the tail. 

	I repeated the 8hz ae vep another 10 times, just in case I could get it more clearly. 8hz aevep_2. 

	Then I moved the ultrasound to the left, and got a seemingly much clearer modulated signal.. So I am now not sure which are the good signals? 

TODO: figure out which files are the side test, and which are the modulated ones. 

4. side test with 10hz vep. I moved the gel across far to the side, so that it is unlikely to be reflected into the visual cortex location place. 

analysis. 
- 8Hz_aevep-notsure-10files - there is a blip at 16Hz on either side. 




It may be possible, that I need to sort through to the 10 best files of the 8hz ae vep and select those that have the biggest VEP? 

NOTE: 
This mouse would be a good choice to do a spatial map on another occasion.
