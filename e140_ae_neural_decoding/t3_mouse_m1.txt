t3 - ae neural recording. 
===================================

Mouse M1, has what looks like some scabbing on the top of its headbar. 
I should do a full test, in a non-recovery experiment. Ideally getting all information I need from it in a single session. 


Attempt at a full test.  

VEP at 10Hz
Spatial Calibration

3 tests:
1. frequency specificity test 8Hz and 10Hz VEP with US at 1MPa. v out = 0.1. 10x repeats of each. 30 seconds duration of each. 
2. side to side test, and attempt at spatial map based on 10Hz VEP. 
3. Acoustically connected vs not. (this should just be the not, as 1. is the connected part)

==============================

This mouse can handle more isoflurane than the other one. At Iso 0.7 it is starting to move. Maybe this is due more to time in exp? 

1. 10Hz VEP, ISO = 0.7. 450 microvolt vep? 

2. Calibration was a repeatable pattern with a maxima, this time off to the left. I guess my refilling of the US has changed this slightly?  

3. ae neural recording, p out = 0.12. VEP = 10hz. Iso = 0.5, preamp filter = 3hz -> 1Mhz. I start a new set with heat mat on, and iso = 0.5. Turning the heat meat off decreases VEP size. 

8Hz AE VEP: immediately the vep is a larger size than the 10hz one. The vep ended up being only 2 microvolts in size. something is not ideal. 

8hz moved 4.5mm to the right. Move DV 1mm down as well to penetrate below skull. 

Looks like I may have just had the US in the wrong place. This bodes well for it being the acoustoelectric effect and not ionic mixing. 
Using an 8Hz VEP. 
ML 7.5:
ML 6.5: can't see it. 
ML 5.5: I can see it in a single recording. This means I could do a spatial map. 
ML 4.5: 
ML 3.5: 
ML 2.5: 
ML 1.5: 

Got the ae 8Hz VEP. 

Note: I converted my first wrongly positioned attempt at ae 10hz vep into side test... as it turns out that it was... to the side. 

I am now just missing the 10Hz ae vep test. 
I got it, but it is small? 

My VEP is just too tiny. stop experiment. Recover mouse. Consider a second innings. 

Stop 4 hrs and 20 minutes of experiment. 
gel had dried, and appear to be stuck to eye/whisker/nosecone. 

13:50 

- I then ran the checker on 10Hz_aevep_1 to see if I got anything. 
 I got everytthing it was just small. 

==============================

start again at 15:17 - attempt at a spatial map using SNR values and a 5Hz VEP. Each file is encoded MLAP. 

I skip the initial vep, and the calibration, and attempt to do a vep based calibration. 

kaiser snr position map attempt. 5hz VEP. looking at SNR calced on 10Hz harmonic. 

I could see it in file 3020 single recording of 5hz vep. 

I can't really see the VEP so clear any more. 

The spatial map looks like it sort of worked, though my VEP amplitudes were terrible. 

Killed the mouse as requested, though I think its head looked in good condition. 
17:52.
