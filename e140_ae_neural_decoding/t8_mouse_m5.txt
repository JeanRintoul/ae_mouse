t7 - ae neural recording. 
===================================

M5, repeat side test and try a spatial test. Is the acoustoelectric measurement spatially specific? 

Attempt at a full test.  

VEP at 10Hz
Spatial Calibration

3 tests:
1. frequency specificity 10Hz ae VEP with US at 1MPa. v out = 0.1. 20x repeats of each. 30 seconds duration of each. 
2. side to side test, and attempt at spatial map based on 10Hz VEP. 
3. Acoustically connected vs not. (this should just be the not, as 1. is the connected part)
4. spatial map.

=============================================== 

1. straight to ae calibrate. iso = 1.0. calibration was not amazing. 
  this mouse hoas the vertical headbarm the transducer and implant vertical part are close together. 

2. neural recording attempt. 10hz. I have a VEP. This time the heat mat is not creating noise. I cannot see anything after 10 reps. The VEP is certainly there. 
 
3. Move down 1mm and try it again with 8Hz ae vep? What I see is lots of noise in the recorded signal. I cannot see any modulation. I put the rpessure down to 1MPa, and I do see less noise. 

4. Altogether though, I am not seeing any modulation. I try 10hz again. 

5. consider turning up the gain? 5000? To me, it looks like it needs to move forward a bunch and I have miscalibrated the position. I got it? 

6. Do side test, based on this. I moved the transducer to the side, and slid the F21 in there at an angle. ideally this acts to block the acoustic waveform reflections from getting to the electrodes. 

3hrs 25 minutes. end. mouse to warming chamber, given wet mash on waking.  

It seems futile to do a spatial map, when i NEED so many reps to see the modulation.
