t7 - 3 test ae neural recording. 
===================================

Attempt at a full test. If this works, I can then repeat it in n=6 mice. 

VEP at 10Hz
Calibration

3 tests:
1. frequency specificity test 8Hz and 10Hz VEP with US at 1MPa. v out = 0.1. 10x repeats of each. 30 seconds duration of each. 
2. focal location, versus 4mm to the right and 4 mm forward(outside of the locus of the visual cortex). 10x repeats. Is there a difference in amplitude here between the modulated VEP at focus versus not? 
3. Two-tone test: to prove f mixing not occuring in the preamp. Remove the US, place electrodes such that the measurement electrodes and stim electrodes are at 3 separate levels.

- This time, I am using the non-twisted pair electrodes. 
- I am going to se a gain of 2000. 
- VEP frequency 8Hz and 10Hz to take it away from the 500kHz peak. 
- VEPs in darkness.

==============================

TODO: mark on the two electrode cable more clearly. 
Nail polish insulate my phantom electrode more thoroughly. 
I definitely need point electrodes as these phantom ones are too big. 
clean up my disk space. 

OR: make a special smaller current applicator and GND electrode pair. 

- silicon was coming off, so I removed it, and reapplied after cleaning head. 
10:56am. There appears to be some bleeding coming from the skull. 
altogether, nail polish works better for longevity.. but then... acoustic impedance. 

1. VEP at 10Hz, 12s, Fs = 100kHz. Iso = 0.6, gain = 500. Mouse moved a bit. 
VEP amplitude = 4 microvolts or 8 p-p. VEP is there. 

2. Applying current with the other PtIr electrode set... I am getting larger amplitudes as I have more surface area exposed. I approximately calibrated, but it wasn't great. 

3. ae neural recording. vep=10Hz, iso=0.6, 10 reps. gain = 2000. duration = 30. 
   p vout = 0.12. 
   If I don't get it... I am going to stop the experiment. 

VEP is there, but 2 microvolts. I have heat mat noise in the data. Stop. 

1hr 26 minutes. 
12:15, into warming chamber. 
I think I did better the previous time. 

Do what I did the previous time.
