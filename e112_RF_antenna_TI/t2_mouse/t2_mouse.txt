t2 - RF TI with a mouse. 
===========================

Goal: Do I see any neural signals induced by the rf antenna? What distance away can I do this at? 

Mouse with inserted electrodes in motor cortex. 

Date of experiment: 22/09/2023  
Mouse Cage: 119465
Number of uses before: 0, surgery 4 days previous.  
Gender: male
Weight: 40g

Ket/Xyl 
drugs:
antidote: 7.4
X: 1.9
k1: 2.7
k2: 1.0
saline: 50

Use the antenna, position over the mouse, use the preamp settings that I had in t1. 
Measure the LFP and spikes at a variety of difference frequencies, all with the 

Final settings:  preamp gain = 1000, low pass with 1khz cut off with 6dB roll-off. 

Running python rf_ti.py and ae_rf_transmitter_transfer_function.py 

df    = 1,2,3,4,5,10,40,100
vout  = 10V. 
- do many repeats when I find something that works, so I can create a spike timing diagram. 
- I also want if possible some measures at lower gain, so I can see the total amplitude ratio between the applied signal and the mixed signal in the mouse. 

- - 

- First find a voltage and a distance where I can see the difference frequency in the mouse? 
Stretch goal: behavioral video of movement at the difference frequency. 

Note diff a is the motor cortex electrode.

4 second duration. 
1. Gain = 1. run rf_ti.py dfx = 100, no preamp filter. Amplitude is a little over 4000 microvolts at 1MHz. I can see df at 100Hz. Its possible it is split into two bins, as my gain is high and daq resolution low. 

2. Gain up to 1000. preamp filtewr 1k. 

The df signal is very small. So I add the cap sheet, moving the antenna down as low as possible, with v out  = 12v. Now I am starting to see something. 
carrier = 1MHz. preamp filter 1k. 

switched duration to 8 seconds. 

These repeats are to enable to creation of a spike diagram. 
3-13. dfx = 10, 40 microvolts amplitude. 

14-15. control without applying any voltage. Can see ketamine delta. 

Now try varying dfx. vout = 12 

16. dfx = 1Hz. 

17. dfx = 2hz. 

18. dfx = 3 

19. dfx = 4 

20. dfx = 5 

21. dfx = 10

22. dfx = 40

23. dfx = 100 

- -  

24. carrier = 2khz, df = 10hz. preamp filter in place. 

--- 
preamp gain = 1000, no filter. 
25. repeat the no filter in place measure with df = 10hz. carrier = 1MHz. 
26. repeat the no filter in place measure with df = 10hz, carrier = 2khz. 

--- Now try moving the antenna around, and see if I can get behavioral response. 

27. behavioral at 5Hz? 

28. 3hz. 

29. 3hz. 

30. 3hz. 

1hr 17 minutes end and into warming chamber. 2pm. 

There is something on the side of the headbar, such that it does not sit flat. Investigate another time. 

I may need to move up to a higher carrier frequency, in which case I will need to decouple the transmit and receive frequencies.
