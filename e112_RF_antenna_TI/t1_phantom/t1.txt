t1 - Phantom. RF TI with antenna and an air gap. 
================================================== 

I was running rf_ti.py 

Using the 500kHz RF antenna, can I transmit a 500khz + 500.001kHz signal into US gel and pick it up? Can I obtain a difference frequency? This would mean there is an air gap between the antenna and the medium. 

This would make for an exciting result, as it would be totally non-invasive. 

= = 
I set the donut antenna up over the gel, with the electrode in the center. 

I can see f mixing only when the amplitude is v. high. 


v out = 10v. 
1. Test at carrier = 1Mhz, df = 1000Hz.  
   amplituyde of carrier in microvolts: 4000 microvolts. 
   In electrolyte sf = 124 microvolts. 

   at 500khz carrier, amplitude of carrier at electrode = 3320 micovolts. sf = 28 microvolts. 

   2Mhz carrier: 3329 micrvoolts. 

   The amplitude of df seems biggest when I use a carrier of 1MHz. 

Can I see a df in the neural range? 10Hz. 

Let's implement a filter, low pass on preamp. Gain = 100, low pass with 1k cut off. 

Suddenly the 10Hz is clean... 

Now I have it working, make measurements at a few dFs that I will repeat in the mouse. 

carrier = 1MHz, Fs = 5e6. 

Final settings:  preamp gain = 1000, low pass with 1khz cut off with 6dB roll-off. 

2. 2khz and 2khz + 5Hz. Same output voltage v out = 10V. 

3. 1MHz and 1MHz + 3Hz. 

4. 1MHz and 1MHz + 1Hz. 

5. df = 5Hz

6. df = 10hz

7. df = 40hz

8. df = 100Hz 

9. df = 4hz

10. df = 2hz. 

see powerpoint. i labelled it better there. 

Result: RF TI is worth trying in the mouse.
