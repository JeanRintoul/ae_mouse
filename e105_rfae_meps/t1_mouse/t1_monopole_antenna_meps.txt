Goal: Elicit motor evoked potentials using the acoustoelectric effect. This time use an rf monopole located below the mouse to deliver the electric field.

Consider also doing an S11 plot of the mouse. 

Also try demodulation using this strategy, whereby there is one pressure field and one applied electric field. Then demodulate at the difference frequency. (aerf_demod.py). Try with the dual wave, and a low pass filter, or try with applying an electric field. TBD. 

1. Calibrate position over the motor cortex. To do this use d bonos current source  and plug in the electrodes into into it. Then move the US over the area until I see a larger amplitude. Note: I may need to adjust the voltage daq range to do this. 
ae_calibrate_with_ae.py 

2. I don't need any python to run the S11 measurement. 

3. use aemeps_rf.py to induce meps.

TODO: fix pi offset in current code. I have fixed it for the constant current (non-ramps part)

- moved daq code v range from 80.0 to 8.0 
- roughly positioned with calibrate code. impednace = 2.8kOhm. at =8khz. 
- do s11. 100kHz -> 1Mhz. 
- preamp gain 100, 30k low pass. set up for aemeps_rf.py 
- readjusted daq range on v to 80 v. 


1. ran aemeps_rf. looks promising, but anesthesia too deep right now. I may need to decrease the pressure, unclear... keep an eye on the mouse. 56 minutes. 

Demodulation with two pressure waves. 
2. aerf_demod.py with two pressure waves 1020 apart. gain = 100 

3. demod, gain = 1000, dfx = 1020Hz two pressure waves. 

4. demod, repeat. 

5. demod, repeat with dual pressure waves. 

Demodulation with one pressure wave, one electrical rf signal. dfx = 1020. 

6. gain = 1000. v out = 1v. pressure = 0.1. 

7-10. gain = 1000 v out = 3v, pressure = 0.1 

11. vout = 6v, gain = 1000, pressure = 0.1V My e signal appears to be railing? I switched my range to 4v. 

12. vout = 8v. yes the electrical signal gets larger... 

13 vout = 8v, pressure = 0.05v? 
no dc offset - analyze? or does this mean no mixing? 
The good news, I am inducing a pretty big wide area electrical signal....

14 repeat of 13. no dc offset... analyze? 

Back to MEPS. aemeps_rf.py 
The mouse anesthesia is still too deep, I cannot see dual pressure meps either. Or any meps. 
Intermittently practice with the 1hz dual waveform. 1 hr 30 min. 
Is it my position localization? or the mouse? 
The mouse still seems pretty deeply anesthetized at 1hr, 40minutes. 
Notably, when i run the rf ae, i don't see the f mixing... perhaps there is common mode rejection? 
The dual frequency stuff looks PERFECT, yet I cannot even see any movements with this. I suppose the energy is localized to one electrode, so I also do not get the common mode rejection of the e field. 
The neural signal looks perfect at the electrodes... but no movement. for dual p wave.  

Maybe it is a bit cold, as the heat doesn't go through the copper plate as well? 
15 1 hr 55 minutes, movement. vid
16 dual pressure meps. vid 
17 2 hz. vid. dual pressure. 
19 1hz
20 2hz
21 8 seconds 1hz, i really only see the first depression. 
mouse waking. 
stop exp. 
22 dual p field. 

2hrs 7 minutes end, mouse into warming chamber. 

TODO: 

Ask Nir of a good way to induce 30hz oscillation in mouse? 
Consider going back to VEPs? 

I see a slight trend, but it is not as nearly pronounced. 

Could I instead pulse the e field to induce mixing at the required frequency? 

TODO:
Check to see if indeed there is the correct mixing frequency? I suspect THERE IS NOT. 
Do FFT of the neural data... what is happening there. Is this similar to what I saw yesterday in the phantom? 
Why did the LED go off in the middle of recording? 


It's possible my cable was picking up the RF noise too, as it goes out the back.
