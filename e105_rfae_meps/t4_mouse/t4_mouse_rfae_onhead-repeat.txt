t4 - mouse 
===============================

It's also possible I had an air bubble in the wrong place. 
I switched to a single layer copper mesh, and a smaller silicon sheet, ideally it will lay flatter and induce fewer air bubbles. This time, spend longer doing a more careful position calibration. 

Mouse with one electrode on motor cortex, the other on visual cortex.  

Date of experiment: 01/08/2023  
Mouse Cage: 110445
Number of uses before: 1 
Gender: female
Weight: 26.0

Ket/Xyl - I am deliberately giving it a low dosage. 
drugs:
antidote:5.2 
X:1.3
k1:2.0
k2:1.0
saline: 50

- calibrate the phantom position using ae_calibrate_ae.py 
- run ae_demod_PRF.py to collect some data with no pressure to look at the ketamine waveform. Make it Fs = 5e3, and 12 seconds long. 
- If desired, run with the ae_demod_PRF waveform too. (set preamp to 3k low pass)
- Place the mesh on top of silicon on the head and lower down the transducer so the pressure wave goes through. 

- Run aemeps_rf.py 
    Do dual waveform US as a sanity test. 
       Can I effect the size by adding a GND? 

    Do AE waveform at 1hz df and 2hz df. Remember to use a ramp. If it works, also run e field alone, and p field alone and get videos of this. 0.1V output for pressure and 4-8V output for current source. 

    If there is time, do RF TI waveform at 2kHz and 500khz. (wait a second, all I am seeing right now is that the TX doesnt go below 10khz. - no I am seeing more than that, but that is an interesting point). 

= = = 13:20 = = = 

Impedance during calibration? 2.16kohm, 16 minutes in i have mesh, silicon and everyting in place and then I start calibration. 

Once mistake is that the gel on the underside and top side might be touching a little at the front. 

very small AE amplitude with the silicon. 

1-5. Ketamine characterization, Fs = 1e4. 12 second duration. No stimulus. Gain = 1000. No filters on preamp. 

6-12. Neural recording using PRF data. US with PRF set 0.0004, 3k low pass on preamp. v out pressure = 0.15, prf = 180, gain = 1000. No high pass on preamp. 
  With pressure it seems like the delta wave has gone down to 2.6Hz. 

= = US MEPS transition = = time since start of experiment: 40 minutes. 

13. tried dual US meps, I could see absolutely nothing. k too deep. Seems like it would have been 200 microvolts p-p. dfx = 1

14. Add GND to mesh. 300 microvolts pp 

15. No GND. 250 p-p 

16. NO GND. 350 p-p 

Idea: It is possible that the mesh is preventing the electric signal from the US from getting through? If so, why do i see the correct amplitude signal at the electrodes? 

That means that dual US should still work? 
The fact I can see mixing on the electrodes, suggests that something is getting through successfully. 

1Hz tests. 
Tested at 1hr, 2 mins. No response. 
1 hr 11 minutes. No response. (using aemeps_dual_acoustic_waveform ) - at 1Hz the amplitude was 600 microvolts... seems huge. 
1 hr 15 minutes: 550 microvolts... no movement. 
1 hr 20 minutes: 620 microvolts... no movement. 
It's true that perhaps I will need to move it around. I am not sure when to do this. 
1 hr 22 minutes, I saw a whisker twitch, when I started the mep dual test. 
17. 

AGAIN AMPLITUDES WERE EXCELLENT, BUT i COULDNT GET A SINGLE acoustic MEP. 
1 hr 32 minutes end, moved to warming chamber. Mouse waking. 

Results: 
# The smaller dosage of ketamine also seems like a good idea, as does the subcutaneous antidote/antisedan injection to overcome the xylazine. 
# I think I improved the experiment set up, doing the position calibration once everything is in place seems better, as does the smaller silicon and mesh. I was able to calibrate position through the mesh, which is good news. 
# At the end, I should have 2 good sets of demod data, and the ability to characterize the ketamine waveform. 


- Can I compare the carrier amplitude in these experiments with that when I did it correctly? Perhaps the silicon is not acoustically transparent? 

Perhaps the neural amplitude is caused by non-linear mixing in the preamp, and is not a real measurement? 

Perhaps the mesh is blocking the voltage from the transducer reaching the mouse? This would inhibit the dual acoustic mep from working - which is what I was testing mostly. 

In this last experiment, I never plugged in the mesh, so I didn't test ae meps. This was an accidental mistake. 

It's likely in both cases I mostly tested just the dual acoustic mep, in which case either the mesh, or the silicon sheet is in the way. 

Next time: try without the silicon sheet - just with and without the mesh. 
 Perhaps I have found a way to attenuate either the acoustic or the electric field from the transducer? Or .. both?

Look at the old data that worked, what was the amplitude for the neural data in the dual acoustic waveform? Was it similar, or larger? 
It was similar scale. Also, I was getting motor movements for about an hour. The mouse was not in the pre-waking state it was properly anesthestized... Something was different. 

I can still measure the carrier amplitude difference between: 
D:\ae_mouse\e100_neural_recording_pat_e_mouse\t6_mep_delta_wave_motorcortex
e100_neural_recording_pat_e_mouse\t6_mep_delta_wave_motorcortex
and this one: 
That could tell me if I am attenuating the electric signal perhaps.
