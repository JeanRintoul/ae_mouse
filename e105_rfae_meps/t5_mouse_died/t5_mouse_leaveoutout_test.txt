t5 - mouse 
===============================

Plan:
I got NO MEPS at all last time, so this time start with no mesh and no silicon sheet in place. Do I see dual meps? If so, insert the mesh and do another recording(with preamp letting signal through so I can see comparative amplitudes of the carrier as well. )


Mouse with two electrodes in motor cortex.  

Date of experiment: 03/08/2023  
Mouse Cage: 115197
Number of uses before: 3 
Gender: female
Weight: 27.5
DOB: 28.01.2023

Ket/Xyl - I am deliberately giving it a low dosage. 
drugs:
antidote:5.2 
X:1.3
k1:2.2
k2:1.0
saline: 50

- calibrate the phantom position using ae_calibrate_ae.py 
- run ae_demod_PRF.py to collect some data with no pressure to look at the ketamine waveform. Make it Fs = 5e3, and 12 seconds long. 
- do a couple of demod recordings at lower pressure, and lesser prf length. 
- then move up to the higher pressure incrementally so I can compare. 
- If desired, run with the ae_demod_PRF waveform too. 
- Run aemeps_rf.py 
- Do not put the mesh. See if I get a motor response. If I do, then add the mesh. 

= = start 10:27am = = 
6 min it mouse is gasping. mb overdose? 
put it back in the chamber with 02 running. 
At the beginning I had iso on without 02, perhaps this effected it. 
it last had k 2 days ago. Perhaps it builds up. Mouse is dead.
