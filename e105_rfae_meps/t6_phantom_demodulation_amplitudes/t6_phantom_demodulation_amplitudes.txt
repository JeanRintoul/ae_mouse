t6 phantom demodulation amplitudes. 
=================================== 

First calibration the position. 
switched away from bonos tx, as it doesnt transmit at low fs. 

ae_demod_PRF.py 
   duration = 8 s
   sampling rate is 5e6.
   set my gain to 2000. 
   pressure_burst_length: 0.000004

1. output voltage = 26 Hz. I can clearly see that the thermal noise is a problem which is going to obscure the signal if I make it lower frequency. 

2. pressure = 0.15V out, gain = 2000. v f out = 26hz. see if I can improve the SNR by using multiple copies of this data at different frequencies? 

Dual frequency 14 and 26Hz.prf 
3. switched to a ti model 14hz and 26hz so I have a more complex wave to recover. 
   I cannot see it. prf 1030

4. burst length = 0.00004, prf 1030, p out = 0.15  ANALYZE this one. Decreasing the burst length makes the PRF amplitude bigger... 

Everything below has 3 and 7hz as the output frequencies. 

5. F out = 3Hz, 7Hz. prf 180, p out = 0.1, fft spread in the result... again, using the other harmonics might help here. 

6. repeat number 5.  At lower frequencies, I think I need more data to obtain spectral resolution. I can do this, by utilizing the other harmonics. 

7-8. Turn the pressure down, and increase the burst length. p vout = 0.1 
   burst length, 0.0004 , prf 180

9-10. p out = 0.1V, burst length = 0.004 prf 180

END. Now go home and create a multifrequency demodulation algorithm. I think this will help with the poisson noise. Done, but the signals were too small. The multifrequency algorithm does appear to improve SNR, but not enough.

Find an amplitude which I can see, then look at how the parameters change to optimize SNR. Can I obtain a 3Hz signal?

calibrated position. Using the impedance adapter not the bono tx. 6

filled in the t6 phantom demodulation parameters spreadsheet. 
dual acoustic wave isn't that great, but the PRF strategy is. 

Connected versus not connected test. Monitor PRF and recovered signal amplitude. 
PRf = 4020, Burst = 0.0004, pressure = 0.13
1-4 Connected
5-8 Not Connected
