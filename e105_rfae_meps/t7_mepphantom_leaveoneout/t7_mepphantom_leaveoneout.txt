t7 MEP leave one out. 
=================================== 

- Calibrate position. 36 microvolts. Seems good enough. 
- Using D Bonos tx. 
- Now run aemeps_rf.py 

Is the electric field effected by the PVDF sheet and the copper mesh. 

Gain = 1. Duration = 8 seconds. 
Inserting objects on by one, but not adding electric power. 
1. US only. 376 microvolts at 500khz. 
2. US and pvdf. 316 microvolts at 500khz. 
3. repeat of US and PVDF. 306 microvolts at 500khz. 
4. US, PVDF and mesh. 367 microvolts. 
5. US, PVDF and mesh. 280 microvolts. 
6. US, PVDF and mesh. 364 microvolts. 
7. US and PVDF only. 280 microvolts at 500khz. 
8. US and PVDF only. 283 microvolts at 500khz. 
9. US and mesh. 362 microvolts. 
10. US and mesh. 372 microvolts.

The above tests how the electric field is effected by the things overhead.
Result: It seems the PVDF attenuates the US induced electric field, but the mesh does not. 

Obtain a pressure estimate, by measuring the acoustoelectric effect with different sets of things there. 

 
aemeps_rf.py, with the current output set to 8khz. 
then on the preamp I need a high pass filter. 
Gain = 10 , 12db per octave 10khz high pass filter. 

11. No PVDF, no mesh, just US gel. 431 microvolts at 500khz ae effect = 2 microvolts at 492khz. 
12. PVDF and gel. 486 microvolts at 500khz ae = 2.5 microvolts. 
13. PVDF and gel. 474 microvolts at 500khz ae = 2.25 microvolts. 
14. PVDF, mesh and gel. 107 microvolts at 500khz, ae = 1.5 microvolts. (maybe i got air bubbles caught too?)
15. PVDF, mesh and gel. 121 microvolts at 500khz, ae = 1.75 microvolts. 
16. mesh and gel. 519 microvolts, ae = 2.94 microvolts. 
17. mesh and gel. 524 microvolts, ae = 3.3 microvolts. 
18. US gel alone. 533 microvolts. ae = 2.97
19. US gel alone. 524 microvolts. ae = 3.1 microvolts. 

The PVDF attenuates the electric signal coming from the US. 
The mesh and gel seems like it should work however I use it. 

Result prediction: 
- US dual modulation should work with mesh and gel, as should RF AE neuromodulation. 
- US dual modulation would not work with a PVDF layer... but... RF AE modulation should if the voltage is high enough?
