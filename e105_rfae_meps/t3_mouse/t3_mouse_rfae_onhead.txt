t3 - mouse 
===============================

Mouse with two electrodes in the motor cortex. 

Date of experiment: 01/08/2023  
Mouse Cage: 115197
Number of uses before: 2
Gender: female
Weight: 27.5
DOB: 28.01.2023

Ket/Xyl - I am deliberately giving it a low dosage. 
drugs:
antidote:5.2 
X:1.3
k1:2.2
k2:1.0
saline: 50

- calibrate the phantom position using ae_calibrate_ae.py 
- run ae_demod_PRF.py to collect some data with no pressure to look at the ketamine waveform. Make it Fs = 5e3, and 12 seconds long. 
- If desired, run with the ae_demod_PRF waveform too. (set preamp to 3k low pass)

- Place the mesh on top of silicon on the head and lower down the transducer so the pressure wave goes through. 

- Run aemeps_rf.py 
    Do dual waveform US as a sanity test. 
       Can I effect the size by adding a GND? 

    Do AE waveform at 1hz df and 2hz df. Remember to use a ramp. If it works, also run e field alone, and p field alone and get videos of this. 0.1V output for pressure and 4-8V output for current source. 

    If there is time, do RF TI waveform at 2kHz and 500khz. (wait a second, all I am seeing right now is that the TX doesnt go below 10khz. - no I am seeing more than that, but that is an interesting point). 

= = = 9:59 am = = = 

2.6kohm impedance between electrodes measured with ae_calibrate_with_ae.py. 

1-5. Ketamine characterization, Fs = 1e4. 12 second duration. No stimulus. Gain = 1000. No filters on preamp. 

6-12. Neural recording using PRF data. US with PRF set 0.0004, 3k low pass on preamp. v out pressure = 0.15, prf = 180, gain = 1000. No high pass on preamp. 

= = US MEPS transition = = time since start of experiment: 
Now prepare for MEPS testing by inserting copper mesh stimulator and silicon sheet.
preamp filter gain = 1000, 0.1hz high pass to attenuate DC, and 3k low pass to attenuate the RF signal. 
Long ramp. signal recording goes for 8 seconds. 
This is when anesthesia is too deep, but I can see the neural signal amplitude and check it for later. 
13. dual acoustic signal, 200 micropvolts pp, 2hz df. 
14. ae signal, 2hz df, current out = 1v, 100 microvolts p-p neural signal
15. ae signal, 2hz df, current out = 2v, 200 microvolts p-p (Note: use 2V when mouse is lighter anesthesia plane)
16. RF TI at 500khz, 2hz df, current out = 4v, not much. about 40 microvolts p-p 
Timing: 1 hr since start of experiment
17. RF TI at 500khz, 2hz df, current out = 6v, 40 microvolts pp, looks inconsistent. 

I can test whether adding in a GND to the measurement area, changes the amplitude of the neural signal. 
18. Dual acoustic field. df = 2Hz. NO GND. 200 microvolts p-p 
19. Dual acoustic field. df = 2Hz. GND. 160 microvolts p-p 
20. Dual acoustic field, df = 2hz  GND. 190 microvolts p-p 
21. Dual acoustic field. df = 2Hz. GND. 190 microvolts p-p 
22. Dual acoustic field. df = 2Hz. GND. 150 microvolts p-p 
23. Dual acoustic field. df = 2Hz. NO GND. 150 microvolts p-p 
24. Dual acoustic field. df = 2Hz. NO GND. 200 microvolts p-p 
It just seems like the amplitude is varying with time... 

What I could do is instead block the acoustic signal with aluminum foil? This would also block e signal.... The better test is to see if two e signals induce stimulation alone(and the answer be NO). If the answer is yes, then I need more secondary tests. Alternatively, perhaps the amplitude of the signals required to induce stimulation is different, in which case this could be a proof point. Mostly I need data now from when the mouse moves. 

25. dual acoustic took video. mouse waking. 1hz

26 ae. 0.12 p out, induced dc offset. 

27. ae 0.1 p out , no induced dc offset. Couldnt see anything. 

28. ae elevate the voltage to 3v. 

29. dual acoustic, 1hz. I am also not seeing a paw movement. 
Mouse is waking. 
Move the transducer to see if that is the problem. 
30. 
end. The amplitudes were excellent, but I couldn't induce meps at any point with any technique. 

1hr 37 mins. 11:30am. 

Why couldn't I see ANY MEPS. It is possible that the US transducer was positioned over the wrong electrode, or the MESH was inhibiting the pressure from getting through. It could also be related to the mouse, as sometimes I cannot induce good MEPS from a mouse. 
This mouse has given good MEPS in the past, though it appears to be different from time to time. 

I should try this exact experiment again. The neural data seemed excellent.
