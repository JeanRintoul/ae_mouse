30.7g post-surgery. 

Good surgery, i straightened and rebent the electrodes so the implant would sit further back. Electrodes not as deeply implanted. 

Total time: 1hr 16 mins under iso. 

AE mouse, for MEPS. Same design as all other mouse. I am running out of mice, so these are to replenish mice before final set of experiments. 
Straight back head bar. 

Surgery was smooth, male mouse. M11.
