Total time: 1 hr 17 minutes. 

Final AE decoding mice. I will need at least n=6 mice to show statistical significance. 

- vertical electrode implant in 3 month old female mouse. 

- This time, I will angle the electrode implant slightly backwards. 

Surgery went reasonably well. Mouse weighed 22.7g with headbar on. 

When this mouse recovers, I should check if it is blind in one eye. Nothing I remember happened during surgery. 
It is just that it's left eye looked a bit whiter than the other one with the Optixcare on it.
