Pre-surgery weight: 28.3g , 26.6g post surgery. Must have had a weird scale glitch? 

I had to re-insert the electrodes, which isn't ideal. Otherwise surgery went smoothly. 

Total time: 1hr 14 mins under iso. 

AE mouse, for MEPS. Same design as all other mouse. I am running out of mice, so these are to replenish mice before final set of experiments. 
Straight back head bar. 

Surgery was smooth, male mouse. M8. 



TODO: get more de-ionized water for the autoclave.
