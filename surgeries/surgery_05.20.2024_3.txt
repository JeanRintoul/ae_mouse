Pre-surgery weight: 26g post surgery. 32.4

I had to re-insert the electrodes, which isn't ideal. Otherwise surgery went smoothly. 
Electrodes, particular the motor cortex electrode are a little deep on this mouse. 
This mouse bled more than other mice when I removed the skin on the head. 

Total time: 1hr 26 mins under iso. 

AE mouse, for MEPS. Same design as all other mouse. I am running out of mice, so these are to replenish mice before final set of experiments. 
Straight back head bar. 

Surgery was smooth, male mouse. M9. 



TODO: get more de-ionized water for the autoclave.
