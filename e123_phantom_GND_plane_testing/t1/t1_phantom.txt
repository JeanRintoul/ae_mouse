t1 - Test if having a GND plane increases or decreases the signal. 

========================================================================

air gap of 7mm. 
Fs = 1e7, carrier = 1e6. 
double chEnables[8]                 = {1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0};
gain = 500
10k low pass. 

keep this in mind when analysing. I did this to enable the higher sample rate. 1e7, carrier 1e6. 
preamp settings 0.1 high pass, 10k low pass. 
rf amplifier v out  = 0.5 
duration            = 6 seconds.

Questions to answer: 
- Is the transmitted electric field larger when the gnd is attached, and in which way? 
    - It is largest when completely isolated. 

- Are there any artefacts after any of these pulse methods? 

1-5 e pulse, no gnd attached. - 598 microvolts
 
6-10 e pulse, gnd attached underneath petri dish. - 497 microvolts. 

11-15 e pulse, gnd in solution. - 213 microvolts

16-20 e pulse, gnd super close to measurements electrodes. 
      its near the 
      electrode base. When I touched it to one electrode I ovld, despite no signal being output. - 217 microvolts 

21-25 fswitching gnd in solution. - 61.3 microvolt pp. 

26-31 fswitching gnd super close to measurement electrodes. - 64.7 pp 

Note: before I did the below measurement, I moved the petri dish a bit. :/ so the amplitude may not be exactly the same. 
36-40 fswitching gnd attached underneath. - 235 p-p 

31-35 fswitching no gnd attached. - 272 p-p
