t1 - Test if having a GND plane increases or decreases the signal. 

========================================================================

air gap of 7mm. 
Fs = 1e7, carrier = 1e6. 
double chEnables[8]                 = {1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0};
gain = 500
10k low pass. 

keep this in mind when analysing. I did this to enable the higher sample rate. 1e7, carrier 1e6. 
preamp settings 0.1 high pass, 10k low pass. 
rf amplifier v out  = 0.5 
duration            = 6 seconds.

Questions to answer: Transformer. Run pulse modulation implementation to obtain amplitudes in saline. 

Saline. The question is should I use both sides of the transformer, or just one? 

No filters on preamp, gain = 1. current freq = 8000, vout = 1 
saline petri dish with wires in it. 
1. Both sides applied. 0.05 height at measurement electrodes when both sides apply voltage. 
   0.76 v at output voltage monitor. 

2. single side applied. 2 v peak at voltage output monitor, and less than 0.02 at measurement electrodes? 

This is argument to have both sides when doin acoustoelectric voltage application. 

Moved to 500khz carrier output frequency and RF antenna from one electrode. 
Metal plate undeneath petri dish on the other electrode. Current amplitude 6v
Gain = 10 

3. Both sides connected. 0.1v at measurement electrodes. 

4. One side(just the rf antenna). 0.02 v... there but tiny. 

5. One side(just the plate underneath petri dish). there but tiny. 0.025 at measurement electrodes. 3v out. 

6. repeat rf antenna side again. 12v output at measurement electrodes but cannot see at measurement area. So, the rf antenna is a load to the transformer.... sucking 9ma out. 

7. Both sides connected. 12 v on v output amplitude, and 11mA going out. 0.1V at measurement electrodes. 

So the RF antenna is a load and can be used as one...

Back to the acoustoelectric question. Exchange the RF antenna for a wire that goes into the saline. 
gain = 10 vout = 2  500khz. 
8. One side is a wire, the other is the metal plate underneath the petri dish. 
   4ma. 4v output amp, measure is 0.339 V. 

9 Just the top wire in solution. 4v out. 0.36v at measurement electrode, current = 2.938 ma. 
   Note at some point my top electrode location moved. 

10. just the bottom plate. 3.6Ma. 4v out, 0.055 v on measurement electrodes. 

11. both connected. 4.047 ma, 0.346 on measurement electrodes. 4v out. I can see clearly on measurement electrodes this signal.

12. top electrode only. 3ma across transformer. 0.378 v out at measurement electrode. very clear. 4v out. 

I mean, the single point v out seems reasonable. However, so does putting a plate underneath as well as the top electrode... 

TODO: look at the current channel... is one of these cases better?
