Electrode placement coordinates: 
•	VEP Location: AP -3.5, ML 2.25mm. Right of bregma for left side visual stimulation. 
•	MEP Forelimb Location: AP +0.0 mm, ML 1.5mm left of bregma. 

Copy Pat's protocol, to ensure better headbar adhesion. This mouse will be used for estim only - so exact copy of Pat's surgery inclusive of nail polish and skull scratching ok. 

The headbar helper is a great plan.  

- I put a bit too much glue at the end over the electrodes which are inserted. 

1hr, 53 minutes. 


I think I should have used nail polish to seal the electrodes instead of the glue, which is taking ages to dry. 

I also think I should re-write my/Pat's protocol into a cohesive whole.
