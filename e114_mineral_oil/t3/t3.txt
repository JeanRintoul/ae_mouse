t3 - mineral oil. 10 Hz focality plot. 
====================================================== 

I still cannot get focality. 

Mineral oil filled cone. Gain = 1 
1. 8khz, 10k high pass, 500khz acoustic signal. v out = 0.5 
   amplitude of the 500khz acoustic signal is: 80000 microvolts. 80mV?
2. Not acoustically connected. Same settings as 1. 
56000 microvolts. Still pretty high... I still get a clear acoustoelectric response? ???

3. Connected again. Back to 82000 microvolts. The US is definitely a source of noise. The closer it gets to the measurement area the larger the source amplitude. Oddlyu, an air gap isn't making a big difference. Also I am seeing acoustoelectric mixing either way. 
Something is very wrong. 

I think this is because the space between my reference and measure electrode is too large. 

I cannot map focality this way. 

END. 
Empty the mineral oil. 
Oil is coming out again. 

I refilled the transducer with water. 
ae_calibrate_with_aet1.py 10k high pass. gain = 1. 

4. the amplitude is HUGE at the acoustic frequency. Something is seriously wrong.  
   my preamp ovlds with gain = 1. Is the problem my preamp, or my US transducer? With the preamp in place, I have more spacing between the two measurement electrodes, hence you would expect a larger amplitude... 

   ae_calibrate_with_ae.py , just plugged into the stim/measure at same time(no preamp). And the amplitude appears reasonable. 

5. aemeps_prft1.py 
  you can see the 10hz in the applied signal. 

wait, it broke... liquid coming out. 

6. ae_calibrate_with_prf.py , no filters. gain = 1. 
insert f21m 3 microvolts at peak. 

7. ae_calibrate_prf, no filters, gain = 100, 
df = 7.97
carrier = 7969. 

8. F21 in place. same settings at 7. 
df = 1.49 (bascially at noise floor) - no mixing. 
carrier = 6572

9. ae_calibrate_prf, try disconnected? (the whole measurement area is floating?)
  df = 11.99 (above noise floor)
  carrier = 4203 

  Why would I get a mixing signal when I am not connected into the system?

10. connected again with F21. 
   df = 2.34 (noise floor)
   carrier = 6494. 

ae_calibrate_with_aet1.py
high pass 10khz. 8khz signal at 2v, get it to a point where i can see the df. 
11. no F21. gain = 100. 10k high pass. 
   df = 4
   carrier = 3947

12. same as 11, but with F21.   (Note there is some water leakage here again, small bubble in cone).
	df = 2.81 
	carrier = 1500

13. repeat of 12. 
	df = 2.81 
	carrier = 1500

14. f21 in place. low frequency df 5hz, aemeps_prft1.py preamp low pass at 300hz. 
    df = 5.58
15. repeat of 14.  df = 10.27  (look at the voltage output data here and whether it is clean or not)

16. no f21. same settings as 14/15. low frequency 5hz meps. 
    it seems pretty clean, but then the water came out of cone. 

I put kwik sil on the edge of the cone again, so the parafilm perforates less easily. 15:22

Results: 
- I need to fix the sharp parts on the US transducer. 
- I need to pay close attention to the geometry when I do measurements as this greatly changes the measured voltage of the US PRF. 


TODO: repeat the F21 measurements with the same electrode set up.
