t3 - phantom noise optimization test. 
============================================ 

Neural Decoding Optimization and artefact tests: 
- Experiment with the sample frequency so that I get low noise with the proposed tests. 
    - with US and without US on signal. In phantom inject a 40Hz signal to modulate up. 
    - do the artefact test in a phantom i.e. injecting 2 signals(PRF and lf one), then inject the 500khz prf waveform and measuring the sum and diff with a preamp. 
    - Phantom Experiment 1: Run two waveforms(40Hz and 80Hz ) at the same small amplitude(both at 50 microvolts at the measurement electrodes). Using the same preamp recording settings as I use in the mouse(low pass filter 3kHz cut off and gain 1000), show that  the two injected signals do NOT mix with each other(i.e. there is no sum and difference between the two of them). It is only when ultrasound is applied that mixing occurs. 

    The problem of injecting two signals, is that unless there is signal isolation, they will mix. 

MEPS optimization and artefact tests:     
- Try MEPS also again, do I get the correct dF in the phantom? Does it change dependent on the Fs? 
   Also, do the proposed artefact test for MEPS which is: Phantom Experiment to Prove it: Run an electrical waveforms at the same small amplitude as is currently measured at 500kHz through the preamp, as well as a second electrical waveform at 500khz +100Hz at the same amplitude. If these waves are mixing together we should see their sum and difference frequencies. If not, the mixing is occurring via the acoustoelectric effect(i.e. due to the pressure of the ultrasound inducing mixing). 

Confound 2: How to show the LFP data is neural activity, rather than just the expected acoustoelectric mixing amplitude? 
Experiment to Prove it: Measure the neural activity amplitude for a range of dF frequencies in the mouse i.e. 1 Hz, 2Hz, 4Hz, 10hz, 100Hz and do the same in the phantom test set up. Show that neural activity is larger at lower frequencies, whereas the phantom activity will not be. This difference in trends is proof that neural activity is occurring.  Ensure to alternate timings in the mouse experiment between 1Hz amplitude and 100Hz amplitude so that it is not based on time under anesthesia.

Consider: 
- MEPS would actually be better if I used an ISI instead of directly mixing two waves. 

Yesterday in the mouse, I think I had a bad acoustic connection, as my ae amplitudes were always small. This would definitely inhibit me getting a good result for the demodulation. What I should do is have a distant reference, not the one that is so close. This reference could be at the back of the mouse head and in the gel. I could also consider removing the silicon. 

Firstly, I Calibrated position. 
Settings: Fs = 5e6, blocksize = 60000, duration = 6s. 
Preamp settings: 0.3Hz high pass, 10k low pass.
Pressure amplitude = 1MPa(0.1V)
'pressure_burst_length': 0.004, 
'pressure_prf': 1020,        

Neural Recording Artefact Test in Phantom: 
1-4. Apply US at the PRF and 70 Hz. What is the amplitude at the PRF? 3.3 microvolts. I need to redo this, using the more distant reference. 

5-8. Apply a current waveform from the pressure generator at 1020Hz using D Bonos isolated current source. Use the low frequency isolator on the 70Hz output. Implement a more distant reference(other wise I DO get frequency mixing), outside the area of the fields(this is also similar to the mouse). There is now no frequency mixing. Also the amplitudes of both the 70Hz and the 1020 are bigger. (Getting zero mixing here, has everything to do with the position of the reference w.r.t. the applied fields). Hence, the mixing is NOT coming from the preamp. 100 microvolts 1020 amplitude. 14 microvolt 70Hz. 'pressure_amplitude': 0.00001V,  # 

9-12. Apply the pulse PRF current only waveform from D Bonos output and 70 Hz on the other. 10 microvolts at PRF 1020. v out = 0.1. (this amplitude is far larger than what is applied acoustically btw).

13-17. pressure and same amplitude 70Hz, with pressure v out = 0.15. I seem to get disjuncts which ruin it a bit. This amplitude seems WORSE than using 0.1V on p out. DONT USE THIS DATA. 

18-19. pressure v out = 0.1V, also duration is 12seconds. I increased the 70Hz amplitude to: 'current_amplitude': 0.001. Not v good. 

In the above, all filters etc were the same. 
These plots should prove that mixing is not happening in the preamp. It can happen in solution however. 

TODO: Now make comparison plots, with SNR metric as well.

Artefact Test for MEPS CONFOUND 1:  
'end_null': 0.1,               # start of end null. 
'end_pause': 0.75,             # start of end ramp
'start_null': 0.1,             # percent of file set to zero at the beginning. 
'start_pause': 0.25,            # percent of file in ramp mode or null at start.
1. Ensure the preamp + filter (10khz low pass), 0.3Hz high pass, is not introducing the non-linearity by applying an US dual waveform, followed by two currents close together. 

Run dual acoustic waveform through 500khz, 500khz + 2Hz. Duration 6 seconds. 
20-23. 500khz + (500kHz + 2Hz) acoustic waveform pressure = 0.1V. 
The amplitude at 500khz(inclusive and post filter) is 10 microvolts. 

Run dual current waveform through 500khz, 500khz + 2Hz. Duration 6 seconds, such that the amplitude post filter is similar to when I inject a pressure wave.'pressure_amplitude': 0.005v, making a 23 microvolts 500khz amplitude. 
24-27. 
I can see no mixing frequency when 500khz is applied at the same and slightly high amplitudes. 
Hence, mixing is not occuring in the preamp.

MEPS CONFOUND 2: PHANTOM
Apply the mesh and US. v out = 0.1V(1MPa), aemeps_rf.py 
Gain = 100. 
dF = 1,2,4,10,100Hz (each 4 time repeats). Total of 16 measurements. each 6 seconds long. 
'end_null': 0.1,               # start of end null. 
'end_pause': 0.75,             # start of end ramp
'start_null': 0.1,             # percent of file set to zero at the beginning. 
'start_pause': 0.25,            # percent of file in ramp mode or null at start.
Filter adjusted to 1khz low pass. 

Using just the mesh, I am seeing the 5hz and 10hz again... ok.. debug. It turns out one of my connections going into the preamp was not connected when this was happening. 

7.6 microvolts without the PVDF. 120 Hz. 24 microvolts with pvdf. Maybe this is height? 
If anything, the PVDF layer makes the signal larger? 

current out amplitude = 2v through bono's tx. 

Preamp is set to 1k low pass only. no high pass to remove DC offset. 

28. dF = 1, amplitude fft@dF = below noise floor of dc ramp things. 
29 dF = 2, can see it better, but close to noise floor. This is because noise floor is big at low f's and low repetitions. 
30. df = 4 100 microvolts. 
31. df = 10 60 microvolts. 
32. df = 100 100 microvolts.

 AE MEPS: 
It looks like there is mixing in the mesh and US which is good, and it is sufficient in size. However, the US mixing with itself is the predominant force at DC. 

I need to electrically block the signal coming from the US, and let the acoustic signal through, to mix with a separate electric signal. i.e. get that aptflex 21. 

Alternatively, organize so mouse brain, mesh, PVDF then transducer. 
Or mouse brain, mesh, PVDF + PVDF, transducer. 

- TODO: try this double PVDF layer and ordering in the phantom. 

16/08/2023 - Leave one out test, with PVDF above the mesh (to block the DC mixing from the US)
NOtably, I am having trouble getting repeatable results right now with bonos current source. 
gain = 100 Preamp 1k low pass. V out = 2V, df = 4Hz. Running aemeps_rf.py 
33. US 1MPa, MESH only. 
    500khz amplitude: 231 microvolts( i.e. 460 p-p)
    DC amplitude: HUGE. 556 microvolts. 
    4Hz amplitude: 184 microvolts(350 p-p), notably it doesn't start until after a couple of seconds of both signals. 

34. REPEAT of 33. 
    500khz amplitude: 235 
    DC amplitude: HUGE: 839
    4Hz amplitude: 120 microvolts.     

Now, insert the double PVDF ABOVE the mesh, and under the transducer. I got sort of noisy signals through. weird 20hz and other mixing stuffs. 

35. 500khz amplitude: 221
    DC amplitude: HUGE: 562
    4Hz amplitude: 200 microvolts.    

36. 500khz amplitude: 227
    DC amplitude: HUGE: 658
    4Hz amplitude: 200 microvolts.    

37. 500khz amplitude: 227
    DC amplitude: HUGE: 658
    4Hz amplitude: 200 microvolts.    

It's possible the 4Hz is just part of the noise around DC. In the FFT, it doesn't appear distinct. 

The signal is smaller, 
38. PVDF below the mesh. 
    500khz amplitude: 160
    DC amplitude: HUGE: 155
    4Hz amplitude: 30 microvolts.  

39 REPEAT 
    PVDF below the mesh. 
    500khz amplitude: 160
    DC amplitude: HUGE: 202
    4Hz amplitude: 37 microvolts.  

NO PVDF
40 What is happening here? I see a giant 20hz thing. 
    500khz amplitude: 129
    DC amplitude: HUGE: 160
    4Hz amplitude: 50 microvolts. 

41 What is happening here? I see a giant 20hz thing. I moved the reference back out of the way of the mesh. 
    500khz amplitude: 674
    DC amplitude: HUGE: 971
    4Hz amplitude: 200 microvolts.  But it is part of the poisson noise. 

42   Big 20 Hz? 
    500khz amplitude: 674
    DC amplitude: HUGE: 902
    4Hz amplitude: 200 microvolts.  But it is part of the poisson noise.

43. use the wire to deliver current instead of mesh. All the 20Hznoise is gone... 
    500khz amplitude: 495
    DC amplitude: HUGE: 2600
    4Hz amplitude: 200 microvolts.  But it is part of the poisson noise. 

44. use the wire to deliver current instead of mesh. All the 20Hznoise is gone...
    500khz amplitude: 189
    DC amplitude: HUGE: 650
    4Hz amplitude: 100 microvolts.  But it is part of the poisson noise. 

45. use the wire to deliver current, and move the reference to right next to the other measurement electrode. 
    500khz amplitude: 9.6 
    DC amplitude: HUGE: 558
    4Hz amplitude: 3 microvolts. But it is part of the poisson noise. 

46. 500khz amplitude: 9.6 
    DC amplitude: HUGE: 58
    4Hz amplitude: 3 microvolts. But it is part of the poisson noise. 

Result synopsis, the size of the carrier and the DC is dependent on how far away the reference measurement electrode is positioned. 

In all these cases, a lot has to do with how it is measured, and the position of the reference. The applied fields are always the same. Thus I could miss out on thinking something was a good stimulation technique, because of how I am measuring. 

I need to think about how to apply the AE field more, so as to not have the DC dominate. 
I don't think it is any good to test in the mouse now. 

What does work is the dual acoustic field. 

Change the filter presents, to attenuate DC, maybe this way I can see the 4Hz. 
I can see that the envelope is at 4Hz now though. 

47. Dual acoustic field. NO MESH OR PVDF. 4hz df. distant electrode reference? 
    500khz amplitude: 2.94 
    DC amplitude: HUGE: 15
    4Hz amplitude: 3 microvolts. But it is part of the poisson noise. 
Note: when I filter the DC, I can now see the 4Hz in the data. The amplitude is less than 20 microvolts... so small. 

What if I use this same filter and reference arrangement with the mesh in place? Can I then see the 4Hz in the FFT? 

48. Mesh. cannot see it. Though it appears to be 200 microvolts in ampliutude. 

49. Go back to applying the field with the wire. (less noise). 
    500khz amplitude: 10
    DC amplitude: 200
    4Hz amplitude: 31 microvolts average. I can see it now. 

AE MEPS solution is to apply the field with a wire instead of the overhead mesh. To measure it I need to have a DC filter on the preamp. 

Now I have a way to apply it, and measure it, what happens when I add in the PVDF? 

50. Field applied with a wire only. 0.03 High pass, 1k low pass. Distant reference. 
    500khz amplitude: 8
    DC amplitude: 125
    4Hz amplitude: 34 microvolts average. I can see it now, I can also see it in the neural carrier data. This is FAR BETTER. 

51. Add the PVDF shield to the US. Now I have lots of other introduced frequencies... I can clearly see the 4Hz though. 
    500khz amplitude: 63
    DC amplitude: 58
    4Hz amplitude: 39 microvolts max. I can see it now, I can also see it in the neural carrier data. This is FAR BETTER. 
52. Repeat with PVDF and wire electrode, and distant reference. 
    500khz amplitude: 65
    DC amplitude: 42
    4Hz amplitude: 24 microvolts max. 

53. turn up the e field. 4v out. (instead of the previously used 2v out)
    500khz amplitude: 133
    DC amplitude: 123
    4Hz amplitude: 69 microvolts max.

So turning up the e field increases the ae field. The DC offset is caused by trhe e field also - not just the pressure field. 

Strategy for MEPS experiment: 
  - PREAMP 0.03 high pass, 1k low pass. 
  - Distant reference. 
  - Apply the e field with a wire instead. 

  Both the mesh and the PVDF induce noise.
