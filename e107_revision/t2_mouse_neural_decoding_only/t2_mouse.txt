t2 - k gamma neural recording. Don't try for MEPS at the end so I have longer to concentrate on good neural recording results. 
============================================ 
Neural decoding test in my new k gamma mouse.
Pilot test for final testing and artefact analysis. 

- set up ultrasound. 
- use new twisted wires. 
- set up cables and wires to apply a signal separately. 
- Does applying a signal at the PRF amplitude in solution really equivalent? 
  - No, applying a 500kHz signal with the same pulse shape is equivalent?

Previously: 
Fs = 5e3, US with PRF set 0.0004, 3k low pass on preamp. v out pressure = 0.15, prf = 180, gain = 1000. No high pass on preamp. 12 seconds duration. 
Now: 
Fs = 10khz, PRF = 1020, v out pressure = 0.15, gain = 1000, 3k low pass on preamp. 
12 seconds. 

- Calibrate position first to position US over the frontal electrode where gamma should be biggest. 
- Neural Decoding: Alternate between a measurement with US, and a measurement without US on, as this forms the baseline comparison study. 
   What settings will I use? 
   Note the amplitude of the PRF. 

1. Artefact Test 1: and artefact test in vivo, no US needed. Inject two signals on separate wires, one at the PRF
(i.e. 1020) and one at a lower frequency. The amplitudes should be the same as the PRF. Show that they do NOT mix together. 
2. Artefact Test 2: Apply the same 500khz waveform as current, and a lower frequency waveform. Show that they do not mix. Make sure the amplitude is equivalent to the PRF measures. 

I am using the impedance adapter as voltage source. 

= = Time start: 11:14am = = 
impedance between electrodes 4.4kohm. 

- mouse appeared not fully paralysed straight away. Still has toe pinch response. 

ae_demod_PRF.py 
DAQ limit at 8v range. 

First calibrate with ae.py, using the impedance adapter as the voltage source. 

Note well: having trouble calibrating well. It is likely I have non-optimal pressure. Continue anyway.  
I get a max of 9 microvolts. 
Be careful which way around I have the applied voltage... 

1. ae_demod_PRF.py , preamp is 0.1 high pass and 10k low pass. gain = 1000
   - PRF 1020, Fs = 1e4, duration = 12s, presure = 0.15 out. 
   - I cannot see any delta waves? 0.0004 burst length. 
2. repeat. 
3. US off. I cannot see the delta signal at all. 
4. US off i can now suddenly see delta waves. 
5. US on(0.15). no delta waves. 
6. US off. i can see delta waves. 
7. US (0.1), maybe i can see. 
8. US OFF. 
9. US (0.1) - 
10. US OFF  -big d wave
11. US ON (0.13)
12. US OFF - big d wave. 
13. US ON (0.13 )
14. US OFF 
15. US ON (0.15)
PRF amplitude is:  33 microvolts. 

Artefact Tests: Running the same waveform through, I need to calibrate what v out to get the same size. 

16-19. Running the PRF 500khz waveform. v out = 0.1 , 46 microvolts. No US, just current. 'current_burst_length':0.0004,
'current_prf':1020, Gain = 1000. Note:  I could try to do current based demodulation with this. 

20-23. Now calibrate a two tone test. ti frequency and see if there is mixing. v out = 0.005
we get a 1020 microvolt scale of: 55 microvolts. 
current f   = 1020
other ti f  = 67
gain        = 1000 

24-27 current f = 1020, other ti f = 31 v out = 0.005 such that there is 55 microvolts at 1020. 

Note: it looks like i CAN see the mixed frequency. 
What does this mean though? Does it mean f mixing is happening in the preamp? 
Or does it mean f mixing is happenign in saline, and/or the brain? 

Also not the cable is running close to each other? I moved the cable further away and repeated the current ti tests above. 
28-31. the 31hz is still there. This could even be coming from the current generator. 

This may require phantom tests to debug. 

END, 1 hr and 22 minutes. Into warming chamber. 12:37am. 
===========================================================

Results: I can see sub-harmonics generated by the US in both the original and demodulated signal. In that way it is demodulating successfully. 

However, I would prefer they were not there. What are they caused by? Is it the electrode vibrating? It looks like there is some systematic vibration which increases when US is applied. 

I don't think it is vibration, because when I apply the same PRF signal as a current only, I can also see these frequency lines appear. Unfortunately I think there is some interaction I need to get rid of here. I bet if I changed the PRF to 1000 it would go away? 

Alternatively, the PRF might be interacting with the sample rate in an unfortunate way?
