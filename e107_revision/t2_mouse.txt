t2 - k gamma neural recording. Don't try for MEPS at the end so I have longer to concentrate on good neural recording results. 
============================================ 
Neural decoding test in my new k gamma mouse.
Pilot test for final testing and artefact analysis. 

- set up ultrasound. 
- use new twisted wires. 
- set up cables and wires to apply a signal separately. 

- Does applying a signal at the PRF amplitude in solution really equivalent? 
  - No, applying a 500kHz signal with the same pulse shape is equivalent?

Previously: 
Fs = 5e3, US with PRF set 0.0004, 3k low pass on preamp. v out pressure = 0.15, prf = 180, gain = 1000. No high pass on preamp. 12 seconds duration. 
Now: 
Fs = 10khz, PRF = 1020, v out pressure = 0.15, gain = 1000, 3k low pass on preamp. 
12 seconds. 

- Calibrate position first to position US over the frontal electrode where gamma should be biggest. 
- Neural Decoding: Alternate between a measurement with US, and a measurement without US on, as this forms the baseline comparison study. 
   What settings will I use? 
   Note the amplitude of the PRF. 
- and artefact test in vivo, no US needed. Inject two signals on separate wires, one at the PRF(i.e. 1020) and one at a lower frequency. The amplitudes should be the same as the PRF. Show that they do NOT mix together.

First calibrate with ae.py, using the impedance adapter as the voltage source.
