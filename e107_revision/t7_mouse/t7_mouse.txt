- use a single thick wire as the way to apply the e field. tape this onto the headbar with copper tape to increase surface area. 

Now I know how to make a good n hz signal, try it in the mouse. v out = 3v. 
preamp high pass 1hz, low pass 100Hz, so that I get maximal attenuation up where I am applying the current at 500khz. 

Try the e field alone, the p field alone, and also ofcourse the combined field.

- ae_demod_PRF calibration, preamp set to 3k low pass. 

I had trouble calibrating, and a massive mains hum. I am not sure why. I think I have a bad connection but cannot pinpoint it. 

Interestingly, this mains hum seems to be effecting the antenna resonance of the transducer and creating unpredictable ae field sizes. 
preamp 3k low pass, 1hz high pass. 
1. no US. 12 seconds. I cannot see a delta wave. I definitely have a connection issue. 
2. demodulation PRF 1020 . Likely nothing since I have no delta wave, despite checking connections. 
    PRF heigh = 32 microvolts. 
MEPS: 
3. dF = 10hz. still massive mains noise, which only gets worse apparently when I apply electric field. it's 1000 microvolts at times, but it is not visible in the fft. 

4. df = 4 

1 hr whiskers twitching. 

5. df = 2 , i maybe saw something. 

6. repeat

7. df = 10 

- - 

6. df = 10 

= = =  1hr 8 minutes moved to warming chamber. 

I had both mains noise, and the surface area of my stimulation was too small. 
I think I also wasn't connected somehow, as I couldn't see a delta wave. 
I probably should have re-stripped off the ends of the silver wire... 


I still have a strange stimulation error where the signal gets larger and introduces harmonics over time... what is the go with that? It happens after 3.5 seconds. 
- to solve it, I plugged a measurement probe into the inner electrods and can apply voltage with the outer probe. can I do it with a single electrode? 

Is the problem that I am using a single electrode?
