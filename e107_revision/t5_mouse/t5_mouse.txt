- use a distant reference electrode formed by a thin wire taped to back of head. 
- remove the silicon on the mouse head as I think at adds electrical/acoustic impedance. 
- use a single thick wire as the way to apply the e field. tape this onto the headbar. 

Settings to try: 
1. Fs = 5e3, PRF set 0.0004, 3k low pass on preamp. v out pressure = 0.15, prf = 180, gain = 1000. No high pass on preamp. 12 seconds duration. 
2. Fs = 5e6, PRF set 0.0004, 10k low pass on preamp. v out pressure = 0.15, prf = 1020, gain = 1000. No high pass on preamp. 12 seconds duration. 

- Neural Decoding: Alternate between a measurement with US, and a measurement without US on, as this forms the baseline comparison study. Preamp filter (10k low pass, 1Hz high pass). 
Note the amplitude of the PRF. 
- MEP LFP amplitudes(not behavioral). Run aemeps_rf at 1, 2, 4, 10, 100Hz. PREAMP settings 0.03 high pass, 1khz low pass. Current delivered through the wire from BONOS TX.

This mouse has fully implanted electrodes... it seems WAY better than k gamma mouse. 

One electrode is on top of the skull(the eeg one), the other is in the brain.

In future calibrate by PRF amplitude. 

1. beautiful delta immediately. 12 seconds, no US. 

calibration didn't work... 
ae first pass was 77....but then it went down. I had trouble calibrating again. 
maybe the v mon came disconnected? 

2. PRF with no pressure to test if I have a delta wave. 

3. 1mpa, 'pressure_frequency': 500000.0,
#'pressure_burst_length': 0.000004, # pressure burst length in milliseconds. (this should be 2 cycles). 
'pressure_burst_length': 0.004,   # pressure burst length in milliseconds. (this should be more cycles). 
'pressure_prf': 1020,      
position 00

4. position 1,0 : PRF amplitude: 8

5. 1,0 PRF amplitude: 16

6. changed duration to 3 seconds to save time. 

- start here for analysis - 
7. NO US. DURATION 12s, at my PRF calibrated focal position. 

8. Pressure 1MPa. duration 12s, filter 0.1 high pass, 10khz low pass. - 

9. NO US. - (it looks like I can see the demodulated output here... with no US, which is concerning). 

10. US (0.15) - 

11. NO US. - i can definitely see similarity in the demod waveform here? umm? 

12. PRF 520 (0.1 -> 1MPa) - 

13. PRF 180 (0.1 -> 1MPa) 

Mouse is twitching at 1hr in. 

Switch to MEPS. 
Insert wire into US gel from Bono TX. 

1 hr 5 min in I administered k2 subcutaneously. 

= = = = = = = = = MEPS - whiskers moving the whole time, though i gave the 1 tick extra of ketamine this time. I think I saw spikes in some files. The spikes seem generally correlated to the stimulation, but not specifically to the frequency applied. I think the DC is dominating as the effect. 

6 second duration 1MPa. gain 100 

14. v out = 4. dfx = 4. 
   big dc, cannot see anything else. 
15. dfx = 4, v out = 2 , changed preamp to ((0.3hz)) high pass, 1k low pass, 100 microvolts. still too big dc. 

16. v out = 2, dfx = 4 changed preamp to 1Hz high pass. still cannot see the 4hz. DC too big still. 

17. v out = 2, dfx = 10. cannot see it. 50 microvolts . 

18. vout = 2, dfx = 100, big thing there but mb noise? 36 microvolts 100hz. mb noise? 

19. vout = 2, dfx = 2, 100 microovolts... unclear. 

20. vout = 2, dfx = 2, 100 microovolts... unclear. 

Now is big, I can see what look like spikes. Analyse below. 

21. vout = 3, p out = 0.13 , dfx = 10, 331 microvolts. very visible in FFT. Analyse here. 

22. vout = 3, p out = 0.13 , dfx = 100, 330 microvolts max. - looks like spikes in the data. analyse. 

23. vout = 3, p out = 0.13 , dfx = 5, 172 microvolts max. visible in fft. 

24. vout = 3, p out = 0.13 , dfx = 2, 200 microvolts max. visible in fft. 

25. vout = 3, p out = 0.13 , dfx = 1000, 200 microvolts max. visible in fft. 
- - 1 hr 31 minutes. 
I can see spikes but not the amplitude trend. 

26. vout = 5, p out = 0.13 , dfx = 5, 1000 microvolts max. visible in fft. 

27. vout = 3, p out = 0.13 , dfx = 3, 163 microvolts max. visible in fft. 

28. vout = 4, p out = 0.13 , dfx = 3,  microvolts max. 1000 microvolts  

29. vout = 4, p out = 0.13 , dfx = 5,  microvolts max. 1000 microvolts  

30. vout = 4, p out = 0.13 , dfx = 30,  microvolts max. 900  microvolts visible in fft.

31. vout = 4, p out = 0.13 , dfx = 100,  microvolts max. 1000 microvolts visible in fft.

32. vout = 4, p out = 0.13 , dfx = 10, 900 microvolts max.  

33. vout = 4, p out = 0.13 , dfx = 1,  microvolts max. the mouse moves but.. not sure how really. 

34. repeat, 

35. 12 second duration, 1MPa pressure only. df = 2 , couldnt see anything. 
vout = 4, p out = 0.1 , dfx = 2,

1k low pass the whole time. 

END  1hr and 51 minutes moved to warming chamber.

- This mouse has great delta, and the motor cortex electrode is implanted inside the brain. The only other electrode available is the surface EEG one.
