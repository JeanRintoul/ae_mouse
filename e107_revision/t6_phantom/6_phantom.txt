t6 - phantom with new prf waveform
============================================ 

- It's possible the non-linearity in the mouse was coming from the silver wires... 
- use copper tape to affix the current delivering electrode. 
- Use the PRF to calibrate the position. 

1. New more convenient calibration. 
- Try calibrating using the PRF amplitude. 
  It appears to work great, using a 3 second duration. 

v out = 3 V, I get a non-linear leap in amplitude for the ae effect... 
aemeps_prf.py works fine. It is really more controllable than applying a field continuously. 

moved filter low pass to 100Hz. 

Frequencies to test. 
2, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80

2. dfx = 2,  I can see the 2Hz, but I also see 10 and 20Hz as harmonics... 750 microvolts at 2hz. 

3. dfx = 5,  1193 microvolts. Later I am also getting somethign at 25hz. It is always in the second half of the file.  

4. dfx = 10, 1058 microvolts. 

5. dfx = 40, 861 microvolts. 

6. dfx = 80, 780 microvolts. 

- What if I increase the ramping time, does this decrease the DC offset? 
- What if I shorten the duration of the signal, does this remove the weird frequency effects I get at the end? 

7. 1.73 volts with ramp as 
'start_null': 0.1,             # percent of file set to zero at the beginning. 
'start_pause': 0.25,            # percent of file in ramp mode or null at start.

8. 0.93, but now my fft has poor res. I have signal applied for 2 seconds. 
'start_null': 0.1,             # percent of file set to zero at the beginning.
