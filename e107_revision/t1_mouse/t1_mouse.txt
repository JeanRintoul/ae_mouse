t1 - meps and k gamma neural recording. 
============================================ 
 
Result: I couldn't really see any gamma signals in the raw lfp signal. 
The previous result I had got were better. Perhaps I didn't have enough k in the system? Perhaps the pressure or pulse duration was too high - it did seem like a large amplitude mixing signal. 
Maybe I didn't calibrate position as well? 

It seems to work better when the 1Hz is there.. not the 3Hz.

This mouse has two electrodes in the motor cortex, and a surface eeg electrode over the visual cortex. It does not have an easy connector but just wires out the back. I'd plan to use both

Trying new low ketamine dosage today.

aemeps_rf.py and ae_demod_PRF.py 

First calibrate with ae.py, max i got was 13.5 microvolts with 2v applied. 

Switch connection to preamp. There seems to be a 3.3Hz present. 
ae_demod_PRF.py 
1. Gain = 1000. High pass at 0.1Hz. 8 second duration. 'pressure_prf':2020,'pressure_burst_length': 0.0004, p out = 0.13V, daq range at 4v. (raw seems to be going up to 2.5 v.) (it appears to be saturating the daq range on the bottom side.)

2. 3.2 and 1Hz... very high. good file. 
3. repeat. switched daq range to 8v on measurement channel to avoid saturation. 
4. repeat. daq range to 8v on measurement channel to avoid saturation. 
Note: there is heat mat noise. 

- - 

gain up to 2000? All else the same as above except: 
5. daq range to 12.0 
6-8. daq range 8.0 , file 8 is good. 
   file 7 didn't seem as good. 
- I need acoustically not connected. 

-- raise US. repeat settings in 5-8. 

9-12. Acoustically not connected. 
52 minutes in, whisker twitch. 
more twitching at 53 minutes in. 

-- switch to MEPs set up -- 

13. i got movement. dual acoustic. 

14. ae meps, current amplitude 1, 3k low pass. 4v. 
15. 6v out (why do I see 5Hz here?)
16. 4v out df = 1hz. I see a periodic tail motion.  (When I look at the file, I see a 5hz oscillation not 1hz though? )
17. 4v out, df = 1hz. (clear 5 Hz)
18. repeat. 
19. dual acoustic. I cannot really see that physically either. There is still hope.

END... whiskers. 
1 hr 10 minutes, moved to warming chamber. 

Why am I seeing a 5Hz amplitude in the MEP ae rf files that are supposed to be 1Hz? 

Note: I have heat mat noise all through this... Is this a problem? 

TODO: 
- I can now do a proper demodulation test on this data, looking at the difference and sum frequencies. 
- Do acoustically connected vs not test as well. This should give me an indication of whether I have demodulation. 
- Look at the MEP data. What was the frequency? Hard to tell in both. 

Next time with MEPs, omit the ramp or make it shorter... 
Also spend some time investigating why I get a different frequency than what I expect?
Can I see this in the phantom data?  

- - 

I didn't catch the MEPS very well on video as I was too busy looking with my eyes. 
The mouse whiskers started moving at 50 minutes in approximately so I also didn't have long to adjust anything. 
There appeared to be a periodic motion primarily of the tail, and not of the forepaw on this occasion, also the data shows a 5hz signal even though I had a 1hz difference frequency. This is not what I was getting in the phantom - needs further investigation.  

- - Next time do MEPS only so I have more time. - -
