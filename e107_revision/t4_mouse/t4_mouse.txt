t2 - k gamma neural recording. Don't try for MEPS at the end so I have longer to concentrate on good neural recording results. 
============================================ 
Neural decoding test in k gamma mouse.

Date of experiment: 16/08/2023  
Mouse Cage: 115578
Number of uses before:1, surgery 1 week, 1 day ago. 
Gender: male
Weight: 29.3g
DOB: 8.04.2023

Ket/Xyl 
drugs:
antidote:5.6
X:1.4
k1:2.1
k2:1.0
saline: 50


- use a distant reference electrode formed by a thin wire taped to back of head. 
- remove the silicon on the mouse head as I think at adds electrical/acoustic impedance. 
- use a single thick wire as the way to apply the e field. tape this onto the headbar. 

Settings to try: 
1. Fs = 5e3, PRF set 0.0004, 3k low pass on preamp. v out pressure = 0.15, prf = 180, gain = 1000. No high pass on preamp. 12 seconds duration. 
2. Fs = 5e6, PRF set 0.0004, 10k low pass on preamp. v out pressure = 0.15, prf = 180, gain = 1000. No high pass on preamp. 12 seconds duration. 

- Neural Decoding: Alternate between a measurement with US, and a measurement without US on, as this forms the baseline comparison study. Preamp filter (10k low pass, 1Hz high pass). 
Note the amplitude of the PRF. 
- MEP LFP amplitudes(not behavioral). Run aemeps_rf at 1, 2, 4, 10, 100Hz. PREAMP settings 0.03 high pass, 1khz low pass. Current delivered through the wire from BONOS TX.

Order more of those terumo syringes? The insulin ones. Get the barcode info on them. 

- red electrode on motor cortex. 1v output. 

- calibrate over PFC, on electrode connected to d bonos tx. 
Calibration 100 didn't work. Oh dear. 
preamp 10k low pass, 0.03hz high pass. 
- try calibrating with just the prf. 

- It looks like I am mostly just getting noise. 50 hz. its as if the electrodes are not connected. 
  - I have a connection problem. The far away reference is somehow noisy. 
  - the 50hz is really big, which suggests something is floating. The second electrode is a bit floating. 
- The signal looks like shit. No delta.

- I switched the cable to the non-twisted one.  
- change preamp cut off to 1hz. 
- 1 hr 19 minutes, twitching whisker. 
1hr 25 moved to warming chamber. I got no good data.
