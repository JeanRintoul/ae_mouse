t5 - phantom. what is wrong with the calibration. 
=====================================================

- If my current sampling rate is low like 1e5, I get harmonics around this sampling rate... 
- Hence to see the acoustoelectric effect, I need the current sampling rate to be higher. 
- I can see it with this new arrangement, such that my measurement electrodes are the same as the mouse, it is just my stim electrodes which are inserted. This is a better set up than before, as the twisted cable doesn't introduce mixing. 


1. Calibration position. I am using the mouse electrodes as measurement electrodes, and the wires as stim with distant gnd. Yes, I can calibrate position. 

0.3->1MHz, 2MHz recording sample rate. 
2MHz function generators. 
13.8 microvolt signal, 28 microvolt p-p 

Timed recordings 
- 5,10,30,60.  I should do a noise floor analysis on these. 
I also did one with a larger signal at 10Hz for comparison at 60s. It absolutely does mix. 

10 repeats at 30s, 13 microvolt amplitude signal, p out = 0.12v
- noise floor at about 0.05, I cannot see the 10Hz 25 microvolt pp signal mixed. 

- 10 repeats at 60s, e138_ae_long_neural_recording.py 
   - this breaks anyway.. memory error.


Today, I am getting a smaller conversion ratio than what I have previously seen in the phantom. when i have a 156 microvolt signal (i.e. 300p-p), I can JUST see the demodulated 10Hz. Also, I am seeing it +- a little bit from 10Hz... i think this is the 2mHz sampling rate issue? 


- 

I mean, it really doesn't look great. I think current density also has something the to with it. The current density around the wire is higher than a synapse? 


- Unless, I can make the VEP larger? 


= = 

TODO: compare the noisefloor between the 30second and 60 second recording. 
Ideally, I need a bigger VEP. consider a lower frequency.
