t5 - mousewith isoflurane, and long duration recordings. 
=====================================================

- also grounding, and complete darkness VEPs. 
- big column of us gel. 
- 30 second duration recordings at 5MHz. Acoustic function generator at 2MHz. 
- When doing calibration, ensure that the measurement electrode is close to the stim electrode.

Inside mouse_stream.c, the Fs of the current generator is 100kHz. 
Fs of the pressure generator is 2MHz.

preamp 0.3Hz -> 1MHz. Gain = 500 for ae neural recording. 
iso = 1.0, Fs = 5MHz. 
5Hz VEP in total darkness. Note down what size the signal is? 
position calibration.  Before setting up, scratch off a little bit of the nail polish. gain = 10 . 
30 second long acoustoelectric neural recording. 
Consider moving electrode a bit forward so pressure can go straight though. 

======= start time: 9:35am. ======== 

I ran veps and calibration with all channels on. 
I saw NO VEPS. 
I tried twice, no VEPs. 
- lets try position calibration. 
- I put no tape this time by accident, but th ref electrode is covered in nail polish. 
- I put the measurement electrode close to the stim electrode. 

Calibration seems possible, but it is surprisingly far over to the right to where I expected it. 

- Since I get NO VEP, why not try getting an acoustoelectric effect in the mouse...
  with 30 second recordings. 

- ae_neural_recording. 10Hz signal. 
  vout = 0.1 nothing. There is something wrong with my settings. 
STOP I think I need to do this in a phantom. 

mouse into warming chamber 1.5 hrs in, 11:05am. 

- Though I pressed on the electrode - this mouse continued to have no VEP. 

- I did manage to calibrate this time, but it was surprisingly off the center position from what I expected. So, calibration is possible - but there is some info here I am missing. It seems like the correct next step is to get everything work.

Phantom 
- calibration appeared to work. 
- Let's try small amplitude demodulation, with long recording length. 
- I have a problem when I turn on and off recording channels. 

- what CAN I do? apparently, I can record for a long time anyway. The issue was actually 

TODO: 
- a series of recordings at different time lengths, looking at the amplitude of the noise floor. 

- fg output 2MHz, recording at 2MHz. 

If I wish to record longer, I can decrease the fg out fs until I get a square wave. 


- preamp 0.3-1MHz. gain = 500. duration = 30s. 
- amplitude of voltage at measurement electrode is about 30 microvolts. vout = 0.01V. 

Single trial recordings of 26 microvolt signal. 

- Time length duration: 
t1_stream, 30 seconds. Fs = 5MHz. noise around 0.018 microvolts, cannot see the signal. 
t2_stream, 15 seconds. Fs = 5MHz. noise around 0.028 microvolts, cannot see the signal. 
t3_stream, 5 seconds.  Fs = 5MHz. noise around  0.035 microvolts, cannot see the signal. 

- 2MHz recording on all channels. 
t4 - 30 second duration, Fs = 2MHz, noise floor around 0.014 microvolts. 
t5 - 15 second duration, Fs = 2MHz, 0.018 microvolts. 

- Switch the function generator to a low sampling rate, or a square wave. A square wave has a bunch of other frequency components, it's terrible plan. 
- 500khz sine wave it is. 

If I increase the sample rate of the function generator output, 
The problem is the noise floor, not apodization etc. 

-- - - - - 
vout = 0.01 or 26 microvolts at measurement electrode. Gain = 500. 
- Then I did a 5 30 second recordings, at Fs = 2MHz, duration = 30 seconds. Pressure frequency out = 2MHz.

- Result: If I get it in a mouse, it is going to be extremely tiny here... and require good position calibration. 


TODO: plot where I should put electrodes for calibration, then try that next time. 
- what if the GND for stim was on the body?
