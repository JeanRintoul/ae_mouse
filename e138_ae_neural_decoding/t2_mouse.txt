t5 - mousewith isoflurane, and long duration recordings. 
=====================================================


- also grounding, and complete darkness VEPs. 
- big column of us gel. 
- 30 second duration recordings at 5MHz. Acoustic function generator at 2MHz. 
- scratch off the nail polish near VEP electrode. 

duration = 30 seconds. 
Fs = 5Mhz

These codes are updated for the channel assignment. 
Inside mouse_stream.c, the Fs of the current generator is 100kHz. 
Fs of the pressure generator is 2MHz.

NOTE: I am not doing this in the dark, because AINA is doing surgeries. I decided it was better to try to do an experiment than not. Also, since my position calibration last time was so poor, I need to first ascertain whether I can calibrate or not. 

Also, I did big updates to the scripts to have less channels. So I need to adjust them as I go. It may be the subsequent experiment which is completely together. 

======

preamp 0.3Hz -> 1MHz. Gain = 500 for ae neural recording. 
iso = 1.0, Fs = 5MHz. 
5Hz VEP in total darkness. Note down what size the signal is? 
position calibration.  Before setting up, scratch off a little bit of the nail polish. gain = 10 . 
30 second long acoustoelectric neural recording. 
Consider moving electrode a bit forward so pressure can go straight though. 

======= 

- I scraped off the silicon/nail polish off the wire. I could go forward a mm and further to the left a mm, as the part in the brain is covered in silicon. 

1. 5Hz VEP, Gain = 500. VEP amplitude? 8 microvolts. Definitely need more darkness. 
   No filters on preamp. Tiny VEP. Much better with lights off. 

2. Position Calibration? Now with the scraped off metal bit, try calibration. Is it any better? No it is terrible. 

It didn't work when I was running a subset of channels, it suddenly started working when I turned on all channels. 
The amplitude is large with 1V out - 41 microvolts. 
It definitely doesn't seem to be working very well... 

TODO: Calibration phantom tests. 
One clear thing that is different, is that the measurement electrode is a long way away from the current generation electrode. 

Try switching the GND and reference electrodes around? 

3. ae neural recording. I think it is pointless as there is no VEP. 
  Stop experiment. Do some phantom position calibration stuff after lunch. 

  Mouse breathing rate very slow, this may also be a problem. 

  1hr 21 min  12:13 into warming chamber. 

  Can confirm my position calibration is not optimal. 

- - 

In the phantom, my measurement electrode is really close to the stim electrode. 
This suggests I should make a mouse like this. So that I can calibrate. 
Although, I can also just place wires in these positions? 

-- 12:20 mouse into warming chamber. 

- Altogether, I have a calibration issue. Which means nothing else really matters. 
- It was a bit mysterious why I couldn't do pos calibration with some of the daq channels turned off.
