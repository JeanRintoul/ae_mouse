t5 - mousewith isoflurane, does US pressure effect VEP size? 
=============================================================

- also grounding, and complete darkness VEPs. 
- big column of us gel. 
- 30 second duration recordings at 5MHz. Acoustic function generator at 2MHz. 
- When doing calibration, ensure that the measurement electrode is close to the stim electrode, and the GND of the stim electrode is on the thorax. 

duration = 30 seconds. 
Fs = 2Mhz

Isoflurane. 
Date of experiment: 15/03/2024  
Mouse Cage: 126531
Number of uses before: 11 
Gender: male
Weight: 25.5g including headbar. 
DOB: 15.10.2023

These codes are updated for the channel assignment. 
Inside mouse_stream.c, the Fs of the current generator is 100kHz. 
Fs of the pressure generator is 2MHz.

======

NOTE: I switch to different timer in the led code this run. 

preamp 0.3Hz -> 1MHz. Gain = 500 for ae neural recording. 
iso = 1.0, Fs = 5MHz. 
5Hz VEP in total darkness. Note down what size the signal is? 
position calibration.  Before setting up, scratch off a little bit of the nail polish. gain = 10  
30 second long acoustoelectric neural recording. 
Consider moving electrode a bit forward so pressure can go straight though. 

======= start time: 10:30am ======== 

1. VEPs. 12s gain 500. 4hz VEP. 14 microvolts, 28 microvolt pp vep. 1.2 isoflurane. 

2. Calibrate: doesnt really seem to be working? 
    I think this GNDING method doesnt really work. I need 2 wires close together. 
    Calibration problem persists. 
    Now take the wire out. 
    I may want to move down, so I am now targeting BRAIN. 

3. DO VEPS again, with gel, no US. iso = 1.2
    4 hz vep post calibration no us. NO VEP. 

4. ISO-0.6? vep is back, but small. 4 microvolts. 8 p-p. 

5. NOW ISO-0.6, pressure = 0.1, 8 microvolts. it is getting bigger. 

6. NOW ISO-0.6, pressure = 0.15, 5 microvolts only. 

NEURAL RECORDING WITH LOW ISO, HIGH PRESSURE? 
p = 0.12, 6 recordings, 3hz vep, 30s duration. 
there seems to be some sort of cyclic noise. from the LED? delta function. 

Result, it's the isoflurane level, and not the pressure.
