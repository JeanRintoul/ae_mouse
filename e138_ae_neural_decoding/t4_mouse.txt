t5 - mousewith isoflurane, and long duration recordings. 
=====================================================

- also grounding, and complete darkness VEPs. 
- big column of us gel. 
- 30 second duration recordings at 5MHz. Acoustic function generator at 2MHz. 
- When doing calibration, ensure that the measurement electrode is close to the stim electrode, and the GND of the stim electrode is on the thorax. 

duration = 30 seconds. 
Fs = 2Mhz

Isoflurane.

These codes are updated for the channel assignment. 
Inside mouse_stream.c, the Fs of the current generator is 100kHz. 
Fs of the pressure generator is 2MHz.

======

preamp 0.3Hz -> 1MHz. Gain = 500 for ae neural recording. 
iso = 1.0, Fs = 5MHz. 
5Hz VEP in total darkness. Note down what size the signal is? 
position calibration.  Before setting up, scratch off a little bit of the nail polish. gain = 10  
30 second long acoustoelectric neural recording. 
Consider moving electrode a bit forward so pressure can go straight though. 

======= start time: 10:00am ======== 

1. VEPs. 12s gain 500. 10 microvolts. It is there, but small. 

2. Calibration. 
   - I tried with the STIM gnd AND gnd CONNECTED, AND GOT REALLY STRANGE RESULTS. a HUGE AMOUNT CHANGES BASED ON WHERE THESE gndS ARE. 

3. Calibration is simply NOT WORKING. I am getting large mixing values though. I think the 500kHz from the transducer i smixing with the applied signal in solution, obfuscating my result. 
 - The applied field needs to also be small for calibration to work. 

- It may also be mixing in the cable I am using! FUCK. This is what is causing the problem... 
   I need to think about how to overcome this. 
   Maybe using the untwisted cable? 

4. Continue and try neural recording, manually positioning the transducer. 
   I can see no VEP. 

   I did a single recording, to see the noise floor... 

5, trying a the long duration recording technique. Didn't work... something is wrong. 

6. do 10 recordings for 30 seconds. 

Problems: 
   - I have a very small VEP, I get mixing in the cable when I calibrate. 
   - why doesnt long recording option work? 

- End time 1 hr 35 minutes under iso. 11:30am. 


There appears to be a 9.4Hz peak... small though
