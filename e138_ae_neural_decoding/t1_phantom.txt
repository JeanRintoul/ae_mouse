t1 - phantom testing to improve the signal to noise.  
=================================================================

Tests to characterize, and improve the noise floor. 
1MPa. Small voltage application. 

- Duration. Does the SNR improve with duration of recording? Is there a limit? 
- Sample Rate. Try 5MHz and 10MHz. Is one better than the other? 
- Does having the transducer at an angle, to reduce reflections help at all? 

Phantom testing for noise floor improvements: 

- First calibration. Calibration works well. 
  - though the wire might have touched, 
  - then I had trouble after a slight move finding the focus again. 
  - This happens if one of the wires moves even slightly. 
  - So I definitely have a calibration issue. 
  


Gain = 100. duration = 8s. 
I keep getting unsuccessful for 10Mhz. 
26.6 snr at 5MHz. 
36.94 at 2MHz? 

If I try to increase the sample rate, it doesnt seem to do it. 
The file stops halfway through... 

I could decrease the sample rate to 2MHz. 

-- -  
TO GET to 10MHz. 
- I need to turn on and off some channels. 
Oh wait, I should keep the function generators at 5MHz? 

I couldnt get to 10MHz successfully. 

- - 13 second duration recordings x 5. 5Mhz Fs. 
   - The longer duration certainly does help the SNR. 
   - SNR = 37.96

It is a pity, I cannot make it a longer duration signal... 
Nor can I easily increase the sampling rate?  
2MHz 13s has SNR 33.54. 


2MHz recording 18s SNR = 30.97. Here the sample rate of the function generator is decreased. fg = 2Mhz. 
5Mhz recording, SNR = 41.18 sample rate fg = 2MHz. 

- 
- So I can change the Fs of the function generator, or recording system independently. 
- My recording system is 8MHz? 

- 8MHz recording, SNR = ? duration = 18s, sample rate fg = 2MHz. 

- So I need to experiment with this offline. 
  If I plug in the US fg to ch 1? Maybe I could continue with this at home? 

TODO: 
- Figure out how I can record for a long duration, with a high sample rate, while applying a 500kHz signal.
