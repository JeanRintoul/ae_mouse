t1 - twotone test. 
===================================

two tone test. gain = 2000. 
Use isolated 500khz voltage source(d bonos) to avoid THD. 

= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = 

I can only go up to 2000 without an ovld. 

Do it with a distant measurement reference. 




Really, it is very easy to get frequency mixing... whenever the fields cross. 

Also, THD can occur if the field reaches the stim electrode hence the isolation of the 500khz source. 

This time I have distanced the 

- 1000 gain resistor test, about 500 microvolt signal. I had 3Hz-1MHz filter in place
