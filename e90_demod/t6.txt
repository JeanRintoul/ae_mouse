AE demod
======

Ephys mouse. 

Try to get some clean demod data. 
Calibrate first. 
do artefact test. 
only a couple of recordings. 


I didnt have time to calibrate. This will be shite. 

7hz. gain = 1000. I see NO VEP. I think I have a bad connection, but I don't have time to debug. It's possible I shouldn't have started this, but I was waiting for the ket/xyl mouse to recover. 

1-10. VEPs. 
10-15: no acoustic connection. 

- If possible - I could use this just for the 500khz signal size comparison. 
   The data had biug 50hz. this suggests a bad connection. 
36 min end

dont try doingh multiple exps per session...
