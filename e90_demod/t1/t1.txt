t10 - 500khz mouse test for demodulation, with a preamp. 
========== 

male mouse, weight on day of exp 31.1g.

- new mouse. 
ae_demod_vep_noise_test.py 

Proposed steps: 
1.  Demodulation artefact test using 500khz transducer, and preamplifier. 
2.  Try to run ae_demod_vep_noise_test.py as a dummy run with LED not plugged in, to see the height of the center US frequency. How big is it? 
3.  Can I see a VEP? @7Hz, @14Hz? 
4.  If so, run a bunch of times. 
5.  Move US so it is positioned directly over but not touching mouse brain, using petri dish with US gelâ€¦ do comparative measurements.

start 10:45am
gain = 500. 

i am having trouble seeing a vep. tuning of gain, and daq range as it was railing. 
lets try moving the input measurement channel to ch 0, now i am using the preamp the diff measurement is done by the preamp instead of the daq. 

1. vep with no us. 14hz. I cannot really see it. 

2. vep with no us. 7hz. can maybe see a 21hz in fft. 

3. vep at 7hz 1000 gain. 

Decision to run experiment at 7hz. 

Prepare and position the US transducer. 
When I first tried with g 1000, it railed, but then after a little bit i could turn it up to this again. 

4. Gain 1000, 7hz LED. 200 microvolts at 500khz. 

Turn the room lights off except for xiaoqi's. iso to 0.8

I cannot see the VEPs too well. I discovered I hadnt turned the temp mat on... 
Wait 5 min for mat to heat up. 1 hr under iso so far. 

5-7. 8v daq range. This is too high. 

8. 8v daq range. The signal at 500khz definitely dominates. 

less and it saturates. 

i see bubbles coming up from the edge. 
i need to stop the exp and save the us. 


END EARLY. 1hr 24 mins under isoflurane. 12:08pm transferred to warming chamber. 
mouse awake 7 mins later, I think it's body was a bit cold leading to the long wake up time. 

I made some major mistakes here, in that i had the heat mat turned off meaning I got a very poor vep, and also that the us started leaking. 


Idea, in ae demod vep noise test, I should also show the filtered signal at 500khz, so I can get a real-time idea of its size, which guides what the daq in put limits should be.
