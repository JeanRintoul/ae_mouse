IMPROVE THE SHIELDING. 

1. Add shielding to set up.
2. repeat the saline test with the new shielded set up. 

 -- - 

3. AE amplitude exploration? 

Very the anesthesia, and see if the carrier frequency signal changes as well? This would be more accurate without the noise. 

What is the ratio of the AE effect in a mouse vs in saline? This would work better, without extra noise.

gain = 10

1. ae demod vep t.py test. 106 microvolts at 500khz. 

2. v=0.1, 112 microvolts. I definitely havbe a problem... 

There is common mode 500khz noise, coming from the transducer. 

3. small copper covered loom tube cone above the base of the transducer. 
88 microvolts. t2 = 79 microvolts. So just shielding this, has decreased the noise amplitude. 

If I change the location of the wire, the shape of the noise also changes. It is definitely coming from this cable. 

4. a bit more copper along the wire. it has gone up to 112... but this may be due to position. 

5. 103 microvolts. I think thefact it is touching the stereotax makes a difference. 

6. moved cable so it had no connection with stereotax and down to 66 microvolts. 

7. us cable complete, with added alfoil to close gaps between segments. 
63 microvolts. Some of this may be due to the cable being positioned away from the measurement wires. 

lunch, then the other cables. 

8. 41 microvolts, not sure why it went down. 32 microvolts

Try covering the measurement cables with copper tape. 

9. down to 27.5 microvolts. 24.5 microvolts. 

Twist the stim wires together, and cover with copper tape. 

10. 13 microvolts. 

11. 14 microvolts. 

gnding us shielding in 3 plACES

12. 15-20 microvolts. 
removing the gnding of the shield and then isolating the shield from the stereotax. 

13. 10.9 microvolts. 

14. adding an alfoil piece as shield for unshielded cable endings. 6 microvolts. 8 mcirovolts. 

Now, repeat the artefact test with these new noise measures in place. 

This is the no acoustic measure. v ouit = 3.0v. 

15 - 20. Measures without acoustic connection. 

21 - 26. measures with acoustic connection. All else the same. Not position optimized. 

27. ae_calibrate. Can I even find an optimal position? 
    i removed the attenuator - no need for that if I am seeking a very small signal. 
    can i calibrate the position? 

28. 83 microvolts. -> 278 microvolts with calibration? 

29. Now I have what appears to be a good position with ae_calibrate, try again the ae_demod_vep... this is the better ae amplitude estimate. 


Note: in my current set up - it is possible that the metal prongs are actively blocking the US. 
switch to PtIR and have it slightly offset for position calibration. 

- 

Artefact test summary:  
29-35. acoustic connection with position calibration v out = 3v, f = 70
15-20, measures without acoustic connection, v out = 3v, f = 70.

TODO: repeat artefact test but with the front electrode slightly offset... using the PtIR probe instead.
