t2 - 500khz mouse test for demodulation, with a preamp. 
========== 

male mouse, weight on day of exp 31.1g. 
cage 110612

gain = 1000. 

- new mouse. 
ae_demod_vep_noise_test.py 

Proposed steps: 
1.  Demodulation artefact test using 500khz transducer, and preamplifier. 
2.  Try to run ae_demod_vep_noise_test.py as a dummy run with LED not plugged in, to see the height of the center US frequency. How big is it? 
3.  Can I see a VEP? @7Hz, @14Hz? 
4.  If so, run a bunch of times. 
5.  Move US so it is positioned directly over but not touching mouse brain, using petri dish with US gelâ€¦ do comparative measurements.

Time: 10:11am
ultrasound is lowered, gain is at 1000. 7hz led. 
fridge turned off as it adds noise. 

1. with no pressure v out to 0, apply vep. 20 minutes since start. I can't really see a VEP. 

2. Small VEP perhaps. 

Turn ISO to 0.8 

3. i can see vep

Add acoustic signal. v = 0.11V 
4. Tail went up... it was weird. maybe this is a seizure? 
iso at 1.5 v out = 0.1v
5. cannot see a vep, but instead a really big dc offset. 
6. 
7.
iso back down to 1.0 
8. 

NOTE: start here for mouse ae veps. v out = 0.1v. 
9. can see vep. analyse this one. 
10. can see something in the demod - analyse this one. 

11-20. repeats. the vep is barely visible in all of these. 
15 - i can see the vep. good one. 
16 - bad one. 
17 - good one. 
18 - bad one. 
19. bad
20. ok. 

21. good
22. good 
23. bad
24. good 
25. bad 
26. bad
27. bad
28. good++
29. good
30. good ++

i can see what looks like a vep more clearly in the time series data, than I can in the fft data. 
i think i need some sort of positioning calibration that works better than what I currently have. 

iso down to 0.8 or 0.9
31-40. 

31. bad
32. bad
33. bad 
34. bad
35. bad
36. bad
37. bad
38. ok
39. ok
40. good. 

41. moved us up a bit. 

artefact test with vep going. petri dish with gel on it. 
42 - 72. artefact testing
49. is good
51 is good. 
52 is good. 
53-70. 
53 is good. 
55 is good. 
57 is good. 
58 good. 
60 good 
lots of these are good... 
69 is good. 
70 is 
71.
72.

end experiment. time: 12:14 pm , 12:22 mouse awake and walking around. 
time under iso: 2hrs 6 minutes

what is wrong with my vep? amplitudes seem low. 
can i try the new silicon gel to isolate the reference in the new surgery?
