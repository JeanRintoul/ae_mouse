AE amplitude exploration

======

Ephys mouse. This experiment is with the stim wires, and does not involve the preamp. I have removed the attenuator. 

Only use ae_calibrate_with_ae.py. 

- run calibrate ae to find the optimal position. 70Hz, 3v out to match the saline test. 
- try to obtain a 5x5 matrix of 0.5mm movements in XY after finding the center point, to show ability to do this hydrophone focus measurement. This also shows it is not a mixing artefact of the measurement device as all output signals are the same. 

Questions: 
What is the ratio between the applied field and the ae difference frequency? 
What is the new 500kHz level at the central focus point now? 

Vary the Iso level while US is at the center point:
0.5,0.8,1.0,1.5,2.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,1.5,1.0,0.8,0.5 for symmetry. Wait 1min after each adjustment to take the 4second AE calibrate measure. 

Get this from the 3v measurement

Does the 500khz level vary w.r.t. iso level? 
Does the AE level var w.r.t. iso level?

TODO: repeat artefact test but with the front electrode slightly offset... using the PtIR probe instead.

Ephys mouse look like there has been leakage. This is not good in terms of headbar stability. My other two mice are looking good though.  

The skull is intact. There is liquid leakage, need to do better job gluing and cement layer 1 next time. 

Iso at 1.5 
Instead of 3V output, I am doing it at 1V output. This means I will need to do the saline test again to get a comparative output. I am doing it this way, so the mouse is unharmed. 

1. really good one... almost calibrated position. 300 microvolts. (2v out)
there appears to be a high degree of intertrial variability. 
I have approximately found the central focus, I am going to skip DV(depth), 1hr 23 minutes. 

2. really big one. 2v out. 

3. 3v out. this can be compared against the saline result. (mouse jolts a little due to the high voltage). 
3v out didnt have a larger value than 2v out. The AE magnitude is very variable. Far more than in saline. 
Sometimes it is a steep peak, other time it is spread spectrum. Not sure why. 

4. 2V out. wait 1 min after switch iso to 2.5 
Iso 2.5. Location at the center point I found. 
giant!
463 microvolts. wow! 
down to 1 for rest, until breathing becomes frequent. 

5. Iso to 2.0. Wait a minute for it to sink in. 
  490 microvolts! 

down to 1 for rest, until breathing becomes frequent. 

6. Iso to 1.5. Wait a minute for it to sink in.
  590 microvolts. 

7. Iso to 1.0. Wait a minute for it to sink in. 
  547 microvolts. 
There appears to be a recovery time. 

8. Iso to 0.6. Wait a minute for it to sink in. 
  473 microvolts. 

9. Iso to 2.5. low... maybe i didn't wait long enough? spread spectrum... 
  still around 100 microvolts. 

Iso appears to not have a notable effect, though my stats are not high enough yet. 
What does have an effect is waiting a couple of minutes between ae pulses. 

10. Iso at 1. 
    167 microvolts. 

11. calibration start? 0,0 Iso at 1. dF frequency mag in microvolts. 

12. repeat 0,0. 

13. 0.5,0 (x,y coord sys). 

14. 0.5,0 (x,y coord sys). 370  

15. 1.0,0 (x,y coord sys). 

16. 1.0,0 (x,y coord sys). 

17. 1.5,0 (x,y coord sys). 500

18. 1.5,0 (x,y coord sys). 280

19. 2.0,0 (x,y coord sys). 

20. 2.0,0 (x,y coord sys). 

21. 0.0,0 (x,y coord sys). 

22. 0.0,0 (x,y coord sys). 

My map isn't working as the time between stims is too important. 

What I should do before ending, is the artefact test, where I apply the same signal but no acoustic connection. 

23. US with no acoustic connection. Hooked up same way as throughout exp. 

24. repeat of 23. 

25. repeat of 23. 

26. repeat of 23. 

Hook up the measurement electrodes such that I have a preamp on and gain of 10. 
I could have done this to get the 500khz measure out? I didn't do this, as it seems more important to compare the ae magnitude from the v component. 

- 2 hrs 35 minutes. At 3hrs I moved mouse to warming chamber.
