t3- noise reduction test. 
========== 

Do a plain recording without ultrasound, turn on and off the heat mat. 
Do I see the noise? 

- Add ultrasound and try calibration. Does the 500khz amplitude change? 

- The LED appears to introduce some transient noise, depending how close the LED source is to the wires. 

- - 
LED creates noise in the data. 


Their is a lot of mains noise. If I unplug all DAQs, and preamp, the noise goes from 20 microvolts p-p to 2 microvolts p-p.  
If I plug it back in it goes to 25 microvolts p-p. 

0.1 High pass to remove DC drift. 

- In the totally raw data: 
    when everything is plugged in: 0.25V p-p. 
    when not plugged in: 0.28 p-p in raw data, but mains noise goes way down to 2 microvolts p-p.
    Now there is noise just at high frequencies. This is systematic noise from something. 

- the step after this would be to change the DAQ range to the minimum to get as much resolution as possible. 

This is much better noise floor than before. Do this next time.

- Today the larger noise source is from the LED.  

- I need to cover the LED with some sort of metal gauze. 
- metal gauze makes a big difference. It could be fitted more accurately to the LED.
