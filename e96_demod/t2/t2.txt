t1 - 500khz demodulation with calibration on mouse. 
========== 

Using the dermatitis mouse or oozy mouse. 
This is oozy mouse. Notably, a scab has formed and there is no ooze. 
The VEP is terrible. I think I should cull this one too. There is no rush here though. 
I could do this and the other one tomorrow. 

crooked headbar mouse has eye damage - cull it. 


calibrate using ae_calibrate_with_ae.py, but in 1mm increments first to get the rough location. 
Then do demodulation recordings. 
Try a couple of different frequencies. 
Then create air gap and repeat recordings for artefact test. 

= = = = = = = = 

- calibrate first, then replug everything so I go into preamp. 
- then seek to measure VEPs. 
- This is risky in that I may not obtain any VEP, but it has the least wires moving. 
- update from last time includes new way to move from stim cables to preamp without disrupting wire arrangement at mouse(or US transducer once calibrated). 
- ulcerative dermatitis mouse has only VEP electrode, and no reference. I can put the reference in the US gel instead? 

14:20 start
preamp at 0.1hz -1Mhz. There is a weird spiking in the data, 

- I need to move back the pincers as they are almost touching the US.
1. I calibrated until I got 283 microvolts with only 1v aapplied.  29 minutes in. 

2-10. iso at 1.5. Checked VEP analysis and I could see something very small. very small VEPs here. 
It is super small, but there. 
iso down to 1.0 for most of these. 

48 minutes in. 

11-25.

Artefact - air gap is 26-40.

41. 
turn off the heat mat and see if weird beat thing goes away. 
the thermostar is causing a weird arteficial noise. It just has to be turned on to do noise. Maybe I need to switch out the power supply for it. 

Without the LED, the 5 Hz and harmonics go away.. this is promising that those are VEPs. 
The intermittent high frequency signal is still there. 


There is a secondary source of noise too. 

Analyse this. If I cannot get the VEP, try demodulating the delta band instead which should oscillate due to anesthetic. 

If I wait a bit between recordings, the 5 Hz seems bigger, i.e. 0.5 microvolts! really shitty VEP here. 

I think I should invest in making a new mouse - but this time try no wires or bandaid. 

TODO: 
- cull crooked headbar blind mouse. 
- there is artificial noise coming from something, I am not sure what... try recreating this with saline. Could it be the temp probe? 
- move the pincers back by a cm? 

- the delta is pretty big... it cannot be time aligned, it needs different processing. Which is simpler. 
- In these recordings I can clearly see the DC offset due to the US onset. 
- Can I see the 1Mhz in the signal as well? 

- this mouse has a super shitty, yet present VEP. Or is it a VEP? 


- order a new small RWD heat mat and thermoprobe. 

stop at 2 hrs. 7 mins. 


-- - Analysis notes: 
It appears that the amplitude of the 500khz signal, decreases with exposure to isoflurane. So VEP signal also decreases. 


basefile 25 is 190 microvolts at 500khz, 2.11
basefile 20 is 218 microvolts at 500khz, 1.7
basefile 15 is 215 microvolts at 500khz 1.8
basefile 10 is 238 microvolts at 500khz VEP 1.8
basefile 5 is 224 microvolts at 500khz VEP 1.8 microvolts at 5Hz. 
basefile 3 is 455 microvolts at 500khz VEP 1.3 microvolts at 5Hz
basefile 2 is 405 microvolts at 500khz VEP 8.4 microvolts at 6.5Hz not a vep 

Can I plot 500kHz amplitude vs VEP height? 
500kHz amplitude vs DC offset. 

time vs 500khz, vep amplitude and dc offset. 



let's also look at some old data with the other transducer. 

- I need to redo the DC offset data so that I can see it more cle
