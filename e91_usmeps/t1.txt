ulcerative dermatitis mouse us meps with 500khz transducer, and ketamine/xylazine cocktail. 
- with first test of antisedan antidote usage. 

========== 
- 24g weight

- observation of physical motor evoked potential, with antidote recovery. 

TODO: trim off the wires without disrupting them too much(to avoid CSF leakage).
This mouse is now an US MEP mouse. 

1. Every couple of minutes, i run a burst from the function generator to check for a response. 

So far I have no toe pinch response and no whisker movement. 

At the 2 hr mark, I could get some ultrasound neuromodulation responses at 2MPa i.e. 0.2v output, with burst length 10000 repeats of 500khz sine wave. 

2. 2 hrs 36 mionutes to recover consciousness.
Antisedan administered.

Heart rate or breathing rate seems high when antisedan is administered.  

Ideas: 
- I should try with a different waveform - similar to the ones listed in papers. 
- try with continuous waveform. 
- consider a more systematic way to move it around. 

Note: the skull seems white i.e. drying out. This may change its mechanical properties. 
In future, always put a bandaid. I think the water tight ones are fine. 

- It may be better to do this experiment in the morning, as the recovery takes a long time.
