t2 - ae neural recording. 
===================================

M5 - vertical mouse. Do the 10hz ae test, and ae isolation test at the highest gain achievable. 

Attempt at a full test at gain = 10000, or the highest gain I can achieve without OVLD.  

VEP at 10Hz
Spatial Calibration

3 tests:
1. 10Hz VEP with shielding test, lots of repeats to make a beautiful comparison plot. 
2. 10Hz ae vep at 1MPa, gain = 5000. preamp + acoustic isolation test with perspex. More than 20 reps? 
3. 10Hz ae vep at 1MPa, gain = 10000.

=============================================== 

1. calibration - seemed to work. transducer located more towards the front than I expected. 

2. ae neural recording at 10hz vep, iso = 0.5. gain = 10000. It is overloading at this gain. I can't turn the gain up past 2000 without ovld due to the amplitude of the acoustic signal. 

One difference is that the parafilm was new yesterday, perhaps providing better electrical shielding. The electrical signal amplitude was far smaller... 

So I got the mixing at gain = 2000, but couldnt go beyond that gain. 
Something really weird is happening, I am also getting strange DC drops at gain = 2000, making this not work. Could it be the RA implant? 

Could it als be the polarity of the cable? It isn't the cable. 

I removed the tape on top of the head, in case that was related - so both side should be exposed to the 500khz. 

The problem is the acoustic signal dominates. 
My two guesses as to why I cannot increase the gain is that the parafilm is too thin, and there is some issue with the RA implant picking up noise. 

What can I do? I can refill the US transducer, and I can use a mouse with the straight back implant. 

So I ran the test at gain = 2000. 

Results:? 
ae10hz test: Its a successful 10Hz ae modulation test. gain = 2000. 
ae isolation test: the electric signal is half the size as it was... but otherwise it seems successful. 

The 10000 gain result on monday was just so good... how do I get that again? I need a much smaller acoustic e signal... i think the straight back connector is shielded better. 
i left the iso too high for measurements 5-10 of ae isolation. 

Frankly, based on my data so far, I could use some higher quality data at gain = 2000 data in case I need to use it and cannot get gain = 10000 for all 5 files. 


TODO: check t1 to see what a single file electrical signal looks like, and compare amplitudes. could the similar appearance amplitude be an averaging effect?
