===================================

two tone test. gain = 5000. 
I could only go to gain = 5000 before overload occurs... 
preamp 3hz-1Mhz. 
The light is off, and the faraday cage is down. 

As long as the fields don't cross, even with a resistor.. they do not mix. 

If the fields cross on the load at all - I see mixing. This is true of saline, mouse and a resistor. 

Wait... now I dont see mixing when the fields cross... i dunno... the complementary test failed... maybe the electrodes moved etc. 

Distance test. 
vout = 0.001
