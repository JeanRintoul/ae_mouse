t5 - ae neural recording. 
===================================

M3 - horizontal mouse.
I have now seen the promised land when the gain is high. I cannot get to this gain when the electric signal is too high, thus I should try to use F21 again. 

Attempt at a full test at gain = 10000, or the highest gain I can achieve without OVLD.  

VEP at 10Hz
Spatial Calibration

3 tests:
1. 10Hz ae test. What is the amplitude of the carrier? Does it change when I use F21? If I use F21, can I increase the gain? 
2. 10Hz ae isolation test. 
3. Try to get some 8hz modulation. 
4. Try to do a spatial map if I can get a good modulation. 
5. Do US on and off today. To see if VEP amplitude effected by US. 5 recordings in each state.

============================================== 

1. calibration. 
   p vout = 0.1 1MPa. 

2. ae neural recording 10hz: i can go up to gain 5000, 10000 ovlds. I seem not to be getting a vep though iso is at 0.5. Heat mat noise that I cannot get rid of. 

3. Do with and without US VEP test. 3Hz-1Mhz preamp, gain = 5000. 11 recordings of each, labelled in a folder. The VEP was there, but I wasn't getting very good modulation... so this really is just a vep with ultrasound versus vep with no ultrasound test. - Done. 

It looks roughly equivalent. VEP is there... 

If I am not getting a clear modulated vep, I shouldn't do a spatial map, instead - try the F21. Does it make a difference to the carrier amplitude? 

= = = F21 testing = = = 
I have NO VEP? 
4. No heat mat, 10hz, 1MPa - can I see modulation at gain = 5000? ASD amplitude shows: 552 microvolts. 

5. F21 carrier amplitude test. Single file is sufficient. 
    - without F21 it is 552 microvolts. 
    - with F21 it is 100 microvolts. 

   Gain at 10000 with F21. I no longer overload the preamp. Do I see any mixing though?  

   The problem is that I am not getting a VEP. This is a different problem, and is related to the mouse. This mouse sometimes has a VEP, and sometimes doesn't. Altogether it seems highly variant in amplitude and I think at iso =0.5 it may be too high as it is never moving. 

   For whatever reason, I am not getting a clear modulation. I was also not getting a clear modulation previously without the F21... so yeah... I could try repositioning. 
   I also have a lot of heat mat noise right now which is getting in the way. 

   Since I am not seeing the modulation effect, I will try repositioning, and then if I do not see it stop the experiment, go to lunch, and come back and try mouse M2 again, after checking the heat mat and thermometer. 

   VEP has gone... not sure... Ok stop. Iso is below 0.5. Mouse is moving a bit.
