t2 - ae neural recording. 
===================================

M4 - vertical mouse. NOTE:THIS mouse gets weird signals... there is either an issue with how the electrodes are placed, or the solder on connector came undone. 

Attempt at a full test.  

VEP at 10Hz
Spatial Calibration

3 tests:
1. 10Hz VEP with shielding test, lots of repeats to make a beautiful comparison plot. 
2. 10Hz ae vep at 1MPa, gain = 5000. preamp + acoustic isolation test with perspex. More than 20 reps? 
3. 10Hz ae vep at 1MPa, gain = 10000.

=============================================

1. VEP shield test. 10Hz VEP unshielded. With and without aluminium foil. 
iso = 0.7, gain = 500. No preamp filters. 
2. 10hz VEP shielded. iso = 0.7 gain = 500. No preamp filters. 

3. Two-tone test in vivo at gain = 10000. Just electric fields. Iso = 1.0
 Preamp is 3Hz->1Mhz band pass. There is clear electric field mixing when the e fields cross each other. Maybe I should just record this a few times. 10 times. Ionic mixing example. I cannot align the fields properly right now to minimize this... and it is worth being aware of. 

 What I should do, is show that there is no mixing in the preamp at this gain and these voltage levels in a 3k resistor.

4. do acoustoelectric calibration. 

5. I can only go up to gain = 2000 before I see an overload. This I am having trouble changing, thus.. try to just work with this gain. iso = 0.5. 

- It has a vertical head bar, so try pasting down the cable so it is more away from the transducer. I also have no VEP? 

- Easy to overload, and no VEP... after some time only... I think there is something weird about the connection on this mouse. Oh no, there is a tiny tiny VEP... gain = 2000. The VEP is just too small... something is wrong with the connection. STOP. 

Maybe one of the electrodes isn't pressed down enough? 

There is something wrong with doing measurements on mouse M4. not sure what... maybe an electrode positioning issue? 

Do the ex vivo preamp test. 

Stop experiment, and do the preamp test. 

Ex vivo preamp linearity test with a 10k resistor. 

I apply the fields and see? 
Run this 20 times just so I have it. 

Shit, there is non-linearity in the preamplifier when the fields cross. 
I then set it up so the fields do not cross. Then the amplitudes were bad causing an overload.
