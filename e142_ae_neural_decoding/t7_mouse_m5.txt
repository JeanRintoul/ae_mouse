t7 - ae neural recording. 
===================================

M5 - vertical mouse.

Try to get gain = 2000 or 5000 10hz recording, then with F21 in place, then acoustic isolation.

============================================== 

1. calibrate.py didnt work too well. I stopped caring. 

2. ae neural recording 10Hz, pressure = 1MPa. iso = 0.5 
   gain = 5000. no ovrld. signal looks messed up somehow. 
   There is blood on the head. turned iso up to 1.0 and stop. 
   I cannot see any VEP. 

3. I stop, remove gel, and guy removes mice from other room for perfusion. 
   I clean up head with saline, and then try do do a simple VEP test. 
   Mouse is waking, 
   Still no VEP. Stop. This mouse now also has a connection problem. 
   I think somehow the electrodes are not connected - this has happened before with the vertical electrodes. The problem is the electrodes bend when I plug in the connector. 
   No signal. Stop. 

4. This mouse has a bad connection. It tried to fix it but still couldn't get a VEP. 


This leaves mouse 2 and mouse 3. I need to make 2 new mice on tuesday.
