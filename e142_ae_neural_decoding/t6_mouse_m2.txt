t5 - ae neural recording. 
===================================

M2 - horizontal mouse.
I have now seen the promised land when the gain is high. I cannot get to this gain when the electric signal is too high, thus I should try to use F21 again. 

Attempt at a full test at gain = 10000, or the highest gain I can achieve without OVLD.  

VEP at 10Hz
Spatial Calibration

3 tests:
1. 10Hz ae test. What is the amplitude of the carrier? Does it change when I use F21? If I use F21, can I increase the gain? 
2. 10Hz ae isolation test. 
3. Try to get some 8hz modulation. 
4. Try to do a spatial map if I can get a good modulation. 
5. Do US on and off today. To see if VEP amplitude effected by US. 5 recordings in each state.

============================================== 
I covered the thermometer and heat mat with tape and 
This time I am not getting heat mat noise. 

1. calibration. was tricky - values were small, but pattern was there. 
   p vout = 0.1 1MPa. 
   VEP is good. 

2. ae neural recording 10hz vep. tried gain = 2000 first. no ovld
   g 5000  = no ovld. I can see it. 
   g 10000 = no ovld. Oh wait.. it is occasionally overloading here. 

3. 8hz? g = 5000. Started doing repeats at iso = 0.5. Modulated signal IS THERE. 

4. Attempt at spatial map at gain = 5000. 10hz vep. 

    I seem to be seeing modulation(single file), but it is not at exactly 10Hz...
    so I may need to manually reprocess these.  

    Spatial map didnt work. 

5. attempt gain = 10000 or even higher with F21 in place. Can I see the modulation more clearly? 
- 10hz at gain = 10000. 
- It looks insanely good using F21.... no OVLD. 

Can I move to Gain = 20000 using F21? No - it just overloads... 

I can suddenly not see a VEP... 

- - I left the heat mat on... though there is some noise coming from it. - - 

This is for the figure: Single shot ae recording with F21. 

Do a 10hz, 8hz set, and a ae isolation test at gain = 10000 with F21. 

Should I do 20 of these, or is 10 enough? It is really boring here. 

STOP: I am just getting heat mat noise. VEP signal has gone... 

Really, the only good thing I got in this experiment was the 8Hz ae modulation at g=5000. I also at least tried the spatial map... It seems that the spatial map is not straight forward... I think I should give up on it...
