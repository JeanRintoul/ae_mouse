t8 - ae neural recording. 
===================================

M2 - 

Try to get gain = 5000 10hz recording, then with F21 in place, then acoustic isolation.

with and without F21 and isolation test. 

============================================== 
iso = 0.5, gain = 5000. PRESSURE = 1MPA. 
gain = 5000 induced an OVLD. 
Switched to gain = 2000. No OVLD. 

preamp filter 3hz-1Mhz band pass. 

1. 10hz VEP. Visible in first file. Continue gathering 20 of these. They look really good. 

2. Added F21 into place. Kept gain at 2000. 20 reps. Suddenly the heat mat noise is back! gah. Mouse is moving weird in these... they have a bunch of noise in them from both heat mat and mouse movements, need to sift through them and eliminate the ones with large movements. I couldnt really see anything 

3. With F21 in place, gain = 5000. Now it doesnt rail. It just seems dominated by heat mat noise. At file 12 I turned off the heat mat to remove the noise source. So look there to see clean files. This will shrink the VEP though. 

4. Can I do gain = 10000? 1 files. I can get to this gain, but the VEP has dissappeared. Heat mat noise back. stop. 

5. Isolation test at gain = 2000. The VEP is super tiny right now. Too much time passed since the original test. The VEP is there, just FAR FAR smaller. 


Result: 
- heat mat noise started when I introduced the F21. 
- The F21 did reduce the electrical amplitude, but I didnt have enough gel on top of it... meaning I didnt have a great acoustic connection. I should retry this, but with more gel layer on top. 

Also, in a future test, I should do only 10 recordings of each, and then the isolation test directly after the first connected test, otherwise the VEP amplitude shrinks with time. 

- - - end 2 hrs 9 minutes. - - - 

- next week, do a single test on this with the new mouse. 
Monday: double surgery, then recovery for them for rest of week. 
Tuesday: MEPS tests. 

Wednesday: F21 test after meeting. 
Thurs/Fri: MEPS test in afternoon after meeting.
