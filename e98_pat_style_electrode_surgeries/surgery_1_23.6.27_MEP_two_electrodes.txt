# MEP double electrode mouse, gives most chance of being able to stimulate. 

Surgery generally went well, but I had trouble getting the electrodes in the drill hole. 
Next time use the 0.7mm drill bit. 

Pat uses 0.5mm drill bit, and says this works... so lets see. 

Unclear if I have really got the ends deep enough in the holes. 

- also, I should put nail polish on before mounting the connector.
