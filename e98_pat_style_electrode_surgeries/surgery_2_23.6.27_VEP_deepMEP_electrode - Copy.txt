vep mouse: 
- The drill size of the MEP hole is 0.7mm and the electrode went straight through. 
- The drill size for the VEP is 0.5mm, and it sits on the surface. 
	This was easier an easier surgery in many ways. 
        It is possible that the MEP electrode is too DEEP. 
- I made marks on the head, then positioned the electrode implant to suit. 
- One good thing I did, is when I positioned the implant on the headbar, I had it sit on slightly wet cement which made it stick there. 


It was good that I had put the nail polish on ahead of time too.
