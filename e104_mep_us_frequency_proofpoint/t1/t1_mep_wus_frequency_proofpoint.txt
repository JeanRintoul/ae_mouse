t3 - mep study with a few different applied frequencies. 
================================================
20/7/2023
Mouse Cage: 115197 
Used in experiments once before, was good MEP performance previously. 
Mouse has both electrodes in the motor cortex. 
Gender: female. 
Weight: 27.2g 

Ket/Xyl 
drugs:
antidote:4.8 (based on Ginnie's advice I will give this subcutaneously to avoid too many IP injections)
X:1.3
k1:2.4
k2:1.0
saline: 50

1. Calibrate position - ae_calibrate_with_ae.py

2. Measure neural and video data for mouse. 
dfx = DC, 1hz, 2Hz, 3Hz, 4Hz using aemeps_dual_acoustic_waveform.py

3. With a dF of 2Hz(something visible), change the carrier frequency from 250000, 500000, 1000000, 1500000. 
   How does the dF amplitude change with the carrier frequency? 

= = = start 10:17am = = = =  
Note: I have the cable positioned so there is some tension on it which is bad.. .I shoudl have ran it lower underneath the neuratar holder. 

1. calibrated position with 1v, 8khz, impedance is 3.8kohm. 27 minutes into anesthesia. 

2-5. aedelta_dualwave_demod.py, 500khz and 501khz. I think I can see a delta wave. 1MPa as the pressure(0.1V)
   Put the 5k low pass in place. 8 second recording. 
   Try 2k gain. My daq input range is now 2v. 
   Try to analyze these files. Is there actually a delta wave, and can I demodulate it? 

6-9. Try delta demod one more time, with 1mHz and 1Mhz + 1khz as the transducer frequencies. duration 8.0s, P out = 0.1V. Notably I cannot see the pressure based DC offset, this suggests I am not getting much pressure out... hence low mixing.  File 7 has a nice delta wave. Gain is 2000. 

Now switch back to MEPs set up. Remove filter. Gain to 500. 
The mouse anesthesia still seems to high. 

In the following we work with dfx = 1000 (TODO: do post processing on this to determine the df trend size in a mouse. )
10. f carrier = 500khz - 
11. f carrier = 250khz -
12. f carrier = 250khz - 
13. f carrier = 250khz - 
14. f carrier = 500khz - 
15. f carrier = 500khz - 
16. f carrier = 750khz - 
17. f carrier = 750khz - 
18. f carrier = 750khz -  
19. f carrier = 1Mhz - 
20. f carrier = 1Mhz - 
21. f carrier = 1Mhz - 

Mouse is still in too deep anesthesia. 
Now, 1 hr 33 mins. Move back to original 2Hz MEP. can I see anything? 
I can see movements now. 
22. 1hz  i recorded video. carrier = 500khz 
23. c = 500khz df = 2hz 
24 repeat. 11:53 

25 c = 250khz df = 2 nothing visible .
26 c = 750khz  not that clear. 
27 back to 500khz. much more visible... 
28. 1Mhz nothing. 

29 carrier 500khz p out = 0.05 

30. p out = 0.1 

31. p out = 0.075 500khz. 
it is somehow not as well targeted over motor cortex. I could still see the response though. 
END

Later: 
Plans: try to demodulate the signal I recorded... it had everything in place properly, is there anything here that could have been improved? 
Make a plot of the difference frequency amplitude w.r.t. the applied carrier frequency(i.e. files 10-21)

- what is the amplitude of the neural signal as pressure increases? It is definitely increasing... 

1 hr 48 minutes then placed into warming chamber. 

- - - 
It seems like 500khz really is the sweat spot, and I got almost no pressure out at the other frequencies. Wait a moment, this in itself is a proof point that it is pressure dependent... as I inject the same voltage in everytime... thus the acoustoelectric effect is based on pressure and not just the injected EM field. 

However, the water appears to align itself to the field lines as they oscillate, and we can see this by measuring the electric field. Does it drop with distance from the source? Yes, but does it drop with 1.r2
Water is highly polarizable, so applying even a small electric field through a dielectric double layer will polarize water molecules along the field lines. 

12:11 am. 

Note: 1Hz is large amplitude and looks great... why not do future tests more with 1Hz? 

Am I really seeing a delta wave?
