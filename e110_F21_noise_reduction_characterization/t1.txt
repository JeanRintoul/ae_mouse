t1 - Test whether the F21 is effective.
============================================ 
- first test. No it blocks pressure too. 
Now I am just interrogating how and when the weird mixing effects occur in aemeps_prf.py. 

aemeps_prf.py at center point
I can measure both the PRF amplitude and the df amplitude. 
duration = 8s. gain = 500. v out = 1v. 
no shielding: 
1. df = 10Hz
2. df = 2hz. 
This time, I am not seeing any of this gunk. The data generated is ideal. 

Increase the voltage output to 2v. gain = 200. low pass cut off 10k. 
3. df = 10Hz.  looks great 
4. df = 2hz.   now I see the problem. I see a 2hz, 10hz and 20hz in the signal. 

Increase the voltage output to 4v. gain = 200. low pass cut off 10k. 
I cannot really see this voltage level on the preamp. It is too high.

5. df = 5Hz, so i can see the x5 and x10 issue more clearly. vout = 2v, gain = 500. There is indeed a problem whereby the 25hz is larger as is 50hz. 
low pass at 3k. 
exemplary file of the problem. 

Settings: 
Gain = 500. vout = 2v. 3k low pass on preamp. pressure = 1MPa. 

Goal: Run these same settings with some mineral oil separating. 

6. The 25Hz and the 50Hz is still there, if anything it is worse. 
TODO: compare plot 5,6... 

7. Remove the RF monitor so there is a straight connection between the transducer and the RF amplifier in case reflections are happening due to this, leaving the oil in place. Do I still see 25Hz? yes i do. 

It looks beautiful when I filter for 5Hz... I am wondering if there is some sort of sample frequency artefact due to sampling frequency? 

On another axis, I cannot increase the output voltage and run the preamp at the same time... 

8. That is it, it is an aliasing problem - and not a REAL thing in the signal. However, now I am not measuring the df amplitude correctly. 

So, I think I am doing it correctly, but I haven't increased the amplitude enough yet. 

9. ae_calibrate_with_prf.py amplitude at 1020hz is 0.49 microvolts with mineral oil in place. 

10. without mineral oil. ae_calibrate_with_prf.py. it is about 1 microvolts. Bigger, but i have oil every where. so this is a bad measurement really. 
The carrier is bigger too. This suggests that US neuromodulation could be due to just an electrical mixing interactoin of the PRF? 

clean up, and consider doing an AE MEPS experiment.
