t1 - transmittance test
================================================== 

petri dish of 0.9% saline. 
frequency list = [100,10khz, 100khz, 500khz, 1MHz, 1.5MHz, 2MHz]
df amplitudes at different frequencies. 
10k low pass, gain = 500. 

vout = 0.4 

= = = df amplitudes taken with filter and gain  = = = 
1-4. 500khz 4 reps. 
5-8. 1MHz
9-12. 1.5MHz
13-17. 2MHz
18-21 100khz.
then I cannot go lower because my difference frequency is so big. 

= = = = resistor test = = = 
1k resistor. gain =1 
- Apply the mean voltage at the carrier frequency amplitude to a resistor. 
  Do I see mixing at the same amplitude if I 

22-25 - 500khz. 
26-30 - 1MHz. The non-linearity is TINY with a resistor on it. 
31-34 - 1.5MHz. carrier 
35-38 - 2MHz carrier. 
39-42 - 100kHz carrier. 


What do I want to plot here exactly? In every case, the non-linear mixing amplitude is present but much smaller. 

Hence mixing is occuring in the preamp at a very low amplitude, most of the mixing is coming from the solution. 

= = = = 

- repeat with a resistor at 1kOhm resistance, with the same carrier amplitudes applied. Does the difference frequency appear the same amplitude?
