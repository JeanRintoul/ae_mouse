t1 - transmittance test
================================================== 

petri dish of 0.9% saline. 
frequency list = [100,10khz, 100khz, 500khz, 1MHz, 1.5MHz, 2MHz]
df amplitudes at different frequencies. 
10k low pass, gain = 500. 

vout = 0.4 

= = = df amplitudes taken with filter and gain  = = = 
1-4. 500khz 4 reps. 
5-8.  1MHz 4 reps.  - the signal dissappears in second half? 
9-12 100khz 4 reps. 
13-17. 10khz 4 reps. I can hear it. 
18-21. 1.5Mhz. - the signal appears to have a weird aliasing effect in second half making it larger. 
22-25. 2MHz 
26-29 100 Hz

= = carrier amplitudes with gain = 1 on preamp == no filters. 

30-33. 1MHz. 
34-37 500khz
38-41 100khz
42-45. 10khz. 
46-49 10Hz. 
50-53 1.5MHz
54-57. 2MHz. 

All results transcribed to transmittance t1 spreadsheet.
