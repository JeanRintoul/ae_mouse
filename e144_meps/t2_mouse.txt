t2 - ae meps pulse test, with DC offset being largest, 
========================================================

F21 is in place. M2 mouse. 

I use the low pass filter, and a tight filter on the preamp together to remove high frequency signals. 

- apply the stimulation through the cup electrode, i will need to use bonos thing in gnded mode. use bonos current source.
- use bonos source at its highest output. 
- calibrate the position of the US using the AE effect itself. Is it bigger in any one direction? Measure with the cheek electrode and other head electrode... i.e. EMG.

Goals: Using the pulsed waveform, ISI 1Hz, pulse length 0.5. 
    - Do a frequency ramp for amplitude peak-peak mapping. 
    - Do e field only, do p field only, do both together. 
    - When mouse wakes up repeat this. 

- Stim cup in mouth, stim cup on arm for measurement. 

==============================

I removed the existing silicon as it was a bit flaky. I put nail polish over the wires on the mouse. I think this will help calibration? 
- 14 minutes in I added nail polish. 
- 20 minutes in I added new silicon.

Measurement electrodes: visual cortex electrode(PtIr) and Cup electrode on left paw. 
Stim electrodes: Motor Cortex electrode and cup electrode in mouth. Gel for conductive connection.

duration 6s. gain 200. 

leave one out test: 
pressure and voltage. vout 12v, pout 0.3: df 137, pp 334
voltage only (vout = 12): df 156, pp 448 
pressure only (p out 0.3): df 120, pp 435. (peak not that visible)
#i would say this isn't working 

vout 8, p out 0.3 duration 10
ae: df 75, pp 366
v : df 122, pp 443
p : df 77, pp 416


Could it be due to how I am measuring it? I switch the measure cup on paw to a wire. 

Wire leave one out. 
p 0.3, v0, df 206, pp 590 - very clear. 
p 0.3 v12, df 168, pp 727 - not as clear. 
p 0.0, v 12, df 225, pp 529 - very clear. 

swap the polarity of the electrodes on bonos thing?
p 0.3 v12, df 49, pp 739 - not as clear. nothing in raw data. 

I switched to the shorter cup electrode in the mouth. 
ae @ p 0.3 v12, df 152 pp 670 - now it is clear? There is a problem with the other cup electrode. 
voltage @ p 0.0 v12, df 110, pp 389 very clear. 
pressure @ v0, p0.3, df 66, p 317 

ae @v12, p 0.3, df = 158, pp 1060

voltage ramp with p = 0.2

Try increasing the ISI so there is more rest time between. 2 seconds ISI.

Measurement

I am seeing largest effect as an onset effect... so lets go with this? 

p 0.2 
v0  12/221
v12  36/594      i saw 3 distinct movements. 
v12/p0  38/185   nothing. 

ae again i saw 3 distinct movements. 55/505   I definitely also have a measurement issue. 

I definitely have a measurement issue... with connection

anethesia too low. End experiment. 

- What I saw was inline with what I am measuring, I have a lot of electrode placement issues though. 
- Also timing is all important, and having the experiment 

It's possible that this was it - it wasn't too clear due to experimental problems which I can solve. 

Timing is critical in this... 

1hr 44 minutes duration. 

it is possible that this is it... needs some experimental refining...
