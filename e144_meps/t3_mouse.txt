t3 - ae meps pulse test(DC ae meps) - mouse M3. Experimental refinement.
=========================================================================== 

Goal: Get EMG working with this test. Take video if I can. Two electrodes in a single paw. Use a leg splint to enable this. Shave the leg first. TODO: This time, plug in the v and i monitor from bonos voltage source... 

F21 is in place. M3 mouse. 

Run the two independent scripts that implement the leave one out test in a way that is anesthesia dependent. 
- e144_ae_vs_v_mep.py 
- e144_ae_vs_p_mep.py 

I use the low pass filter, and a tight filter on the preamp together to remove high frequency signals. 

- Switch to measuring I and V through Bono's source. 
Fs = 2e6. 
Try new scripts which interleave the pressure only/e field only/ae effect to isolate from the effects of changing anesthesia level.  


- use bonos source at its highest output. 
- calibrate the position of the US using the AE effect itself. Is it bigger in any one direction? Measure with the cheek electrode and other head electrode... i.e. EMG.

- replaced the silicon as is was lifting up. 8 minutes in. 

Measurement electrodes: visual cortex electrode(PtIr) and Cup electrode on left paw. 
Stim electrodes: Motor Cortex electrode and cup electrode in mouth. Gel for conductive connection. 
D Bonos voltage source. 

26 minutes to get set up, the splint arm EMG prep seemed to go ok, but I haven't done a measurement yet. 


Code: e144_aedc_mep_pulse.py 

gain = 200. 
vout  = 6   
isi    = 0.5 hz, pulse length 0.5Hz. 
pout = 0.2 
filter 0.1 -> 1k

= = = = = 

3 peaks in 6 seconds. 

v=8v ( i adjusted the software filt cut to be lp only) - looks good
pressure and voltage pp = 200 
pressure only pp = 105 
voltage only pp = 143

added start pause:end pause into the peak-peak calculation. 
gain to 500. I dont get ovld. 

ae pp = 62 
v pp  = 
p pp = 


- i am not seeing any emg yet. I also am not seeing the acoustoelectric size variation - perhaps because thats a spatially local effect. This all sounds correct, and suggests I need a brain measurement as well? 

at pout = 0.4 I saw a small movement. 

Do I see any emg? NO I dont. 

I see an onset effect movement only. 
I am not picking it up on the EMG set up. 

I think I should wait until the mouse has a larger response and keep going to fully test the EMG capabilty. 

I am not really seeing much muscle movement at all visually at p out = 0.4 so far. 
Trying just with pressure, and I still cannot see EMG. 


Suddenly I am seeing movements, but still no EMG measurement. 

So my EMG isn't really working so great. 
I am also not seeing really great clean movements either.

How to test EMG measurement? 
The best way would be to apply a direct current field using a cup electrode and motor cortex electrode, then try to measure the EMG on the arm. The problem here, is that the low frequency field will not be filtered out. 

If that is the case - can I at least measure a heartbeat by connecting tale/arm.
