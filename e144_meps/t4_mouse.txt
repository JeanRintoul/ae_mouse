t3 -
=========================================================================== 

Goal: Can I get EMG working at all? If I can, do current versus EMG amplitude plot? Or voltage out vs EMG amplitude?

Ketamine. 
Ket/Xyl
drugs:
antidote: 4
X: 1.
k1: 1.
k2: 1.0
saline: 50

Date of experiment: 23/05/2024  
Mouse Cage: 131589
Number of uses before: 1
Gender: female
Weight: 23.3g including headbar. 
DOB: 24.12.2023

- ketamine took a while to take effect. 
- I set up the original voltage source measurement set up so I can measure current. 

- extra ket at 26 minutes in. less than a tick. 

- oh crap... my new cup electrode wasn't connected? So the last experiment, t3 was no fgood. 

I am not seeing anything with the EMG electrodes...  

I finally got a 50hz with a cup electrode and a ptir electrode... gain 500. 

= = = 

ok can i simply repeat what i did yesterday? 

I get a really clear movement with just pressure. 

I have a emg electrode stabbed through the tail, so I can see heartbeat which is ool. 

leave one out. 

p 0.3 no movement pp = 287
v= 8 pp = 209 
v = 8, p 0.3 pp = 304

Analyze these, with matching videos. 

p 0.35 i can see stuff. v = 10 
ae = 427, 422, 473, 413
p = 305, 343, 347, 
v = 239, 288, 

After that it seemed to get into a different anesthesia state, where it only responded to the onset.  ? stop experiment.

I got some good files amnd some good video. Now go back and correlate it back together. 
- take a second look at the MEG data. 

Mouse 6 did a good job using US as well, despite it being not able to fit perfectly into neurotar while plugged in due to implant angle. 

The videos and the files should have co-correlated times. 

The petri dish tape splint works better than taping without a splint.

Only 1 of my cup electrodes seems to be working? 


- the electrode through the tail seems to work...
