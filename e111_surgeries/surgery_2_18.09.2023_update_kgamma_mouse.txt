Electrode placement coordinates: 
•	VEP Location: AP -3.5, ML 2.25mm. Right of bregma for left side visual stimulation. 
•	MEP Forelimb Location: AP +0.0 mm, ML 2.0mm left of bregma. 

This time, remove the PtIr ball from the electrode mount, and have the end of the PtIr wire penetrate through the drill hole, very slightly. 

Be careful where I place the dental cement, so that it doesn't inhibit sliding onto the neurotar. 

Measure the impedance at the end of the surgery.

When I put the mouse in the stereotax the headbar was loose, so I decided to kill previous mouse. 

Male: 31.7g Sibling of the mouse earlier in the day. 
When I put dental cement, it covered the motor cortex electrode ever so slightly - so not confident this will work. Mouse 1 was clearer.
