- I should ensure I measure the impedance at the end of the implantation procedure and that it is 5k or less? 
- I should put the nail polish on before the end of surgery. 

- no more stim gel needed if i stick the wires in... 
- I should roughen thes skull surface, particularly near where the dental cement is applied so that I get a higher surface area on the skull to adhere to.
