t3 - obtaining an rf antenna effect using PtIr plate electrode and parafilm. 
================================================

use ae_calibrate_with_ae.py

OMG, yes, the electrolyte is an RF antenna. This proves how US neuromodulation works. 

Can I use this?


1. shows the rf_receiver_test response of generating a 500khz electric field with just a monopole PtIr shielded antenna. 

2. Do it deliberately, to try to create the acoustoelectric effect. 

3. I am trying to generate the acoustoelectric effect with a monopole antenna, but notably, it is an open circuit and I am havign trouble sending anything in... so the voltage is super small. 

Wait a second, why can I see the pressure in an electrolyte, but not the 8k? Perhaps the frequency is too low? 

All of a sudden I am seeing absolutely nothing. 

I took it out and put glad wrap on the ptir part, so it is a thinner/smaller capacitance. 
Now, I can see something at 500khz... but not at 8kHz. 

Ran ae_rf_transmitter_transfer_function.py. This looks at just the response of the home made monopole antenna in terms of capacitive transmission into the medium. 

Gain = 500. 


The low frequencies are poor dielectric absorbers... This is known.

For demodulation I should use maybe 650 kHz in both acoustic and e field?
