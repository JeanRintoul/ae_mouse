t1 - phantom study and test of updated codes. 
================================================

= = = = 

1. run ae_calibrate_with_ae.py 
it was high enough in the first position so I didn't both to calibrate the position further. 

2. ae_calibratE_with_Ae_PRF1k.py works for the ramps now as well. 

3. ae_calibrate_with_dualpwave.py 
   - sending a dual sine wave through to the pressure appears to work as well. 

4. Consider doing actual useful tests.

- send through a single sine wave in a loop, and measure the rf amplifier signal amplitude, as well as the measured signal amplitude, as measured through the preamp?
