t4 - 672.8khz: Optimize the amplitude of the carrier electrical signal. 
===============================

p out = 0.3V. 0.8MPa.

The closer the antenna is to the measurement area the larger the amplitude. 

Notably, the frequencies are forked. This is not an aliasing effect. It is due to lack of isolationg of the signal output?

Mapping the RF antenna Acoustoelectric effect in saline. 
  - acoustic signal = 500khz 1MPa (0.1V)
  - copper plate at the bottom with fg 12V and D Bonos transformer. 

Preamp has low pass set to 30khz to decrease the amplitude of the rf signal. 


While I can get an accurate dF, the carrier F and applied e field are attenuated by my input filter, however, I can report their filtered magnitude showing how they vary in space. 

- my mouse_stream.c DAQ ranges were wrong. 

23.07.27 try again to get the spatial plot. I think that my probe could have been moving. 
Today, my mixing df frequency appears large. 94 microvolts in the phantom. Notably, I have more gel. 
Perhaps I have more charges to move. This would explain the amplitude difference between a mouse and saline. 
The mouse is a larger volume of ionic solution. 

I have also placed the probe flat instead of vertical.... 

There appears no amplitude issue with using a monopole antenna.
