t3 - acoustoelectric neural recording 4Hz, attempt at repeat. 
=================================================================

4Hz VEP, try with slightly higher pressure. No F21. Careful calibration.

- ensure that the two electrodes are not electrically connected via the gel. 
- calibrate position, using the VEP electrode as the current source, and two external to head references. 
- Perform  Kaiser windowed, and SNR averaged acoustoelectric neural recording. 
  Do LOTS of repeats.  
- remember to do depth calibration. 

For neural recording: 
- On preamp, implement a high pass filter - 1Hz. Gain = 5000
- Consider a 12s recording time? 
- higher pressure. vout = 0.12

Nail polish to cover bits of showing metal at 10 mins in. 
These bits of metal on the wire showing were closer to the middle, and may be causing a position calibration error.

5 mins, lots of whisker twitching. 

1. VEPS only. Solid 25 microvolt VEP. 

2. Calibration. Ok it didnt work that well. It was a big size, then suddenly small. Do not know why. 

3. AE Neural recording.  Do groups of 10 files only. That's enough. 
   gain = 500
   1hz high pass
   4hz led. 
   duration = 12. 
   p vout = 0.12. 
   Looks like nothing there after 10 recordings. stop. 
   signal snr/kaiser snr/individual_signal snr: 8.2 5.89 0.35

4. PRF test? 
gain = 100. Nothing. My results look nothing like before... 
Weird.. its like there is an issue with pressure coming out? 

1hr 22 mins mouse wakes, adminster k2 

5. Try a higher LED frequency to get to lower noise floor. Moved the transducer down lower so the focus is lower. 8hz LED, look for 16Hz peak. 10 reps. Nothing. 
I moved it around a bit between recordings to get a range. Totally non-systematic. 

Mouse is waking at file 4. Stop. 
Nothing. Just nothing. 
I think I should move back to phantom work. 
Try to get an even small amplitude signal. 

1hr 49 mins into warming chamber. 17:13. 

What if the electrical noise around the 500kHz, is caused by reflections? 
Does more energy get reflected back in the mouse, than in the petri dish? 

I also couldn't repeat any of the PRF results... ? 

= = = 

Consider free styling with a few different locations. Name each file with the coords. 
Is there a non-conductive gel I could use? 
Consider trying the other transducer?
