t3 - acoustoelectric neural recording 4Hz, attempt at repeat. 
=================================================================

No F21. 
Ket baseline
4Hz VEP alone. 
4Hz, just try to repeat last weeks successful AE result. Is it repeatable? 
Try to do a two tone test as well. 

TODO: Put nail polish on wires of this mouse. 

Ket/Xyl

- ensure that the two electrodes are not electrically connected via the gel. 
- calibrate position, using the VEP electrode as the current source, and two external to head references. 
- Perform  Kaiser windowed, and SNR averaged acoustoelectric neural recording. 
  Do LOTS of repeats.  
- remember to do depth calibration. 
- consider, no filters on preamp? If I do a test run with US running, do I get a big DC offset or not? 

Back down to 1MPa, now I have got rid of the F21.

- gave mouse low doses, it is a small mouse. It did not go unconscious entirely straight away. I am definitely at a borderline dosage level. It did settle down to stillness after 10 mins. 
- nail polish at 9 mins in. 

1. ketamine baseline, 100kHz Fs. Duration 12s. Gain = 500. 
2. 4hz VEP. Duration 12s. Gain = 500. Can I see a VEP on the new mouse? 
   NO VEP. Problem. I think the silicon isn't strong enough, and I need to put the glue or clear nail polish to stablize the electrode. I was very careful with the mouses eyes not to damage anything near them in any way. The silicon did seem to keep the skull moist and not dried out. now I have a little something I think. It is small at 20 microvolts. 
3. Add clear nail polish to solidify position of the VEP electrode. I definitely have a VEP. 35 minutes applied clear nail polish. This experiment will not have enough time to complete due to this nail polish drying business. Consider the ketamine dosage.
4. Collect another 10 VEPs while I wait for nail polish to dry. 32 microvolts VEP. Not bad. 
5. Re-arrange wires and calibrate position at 1hr in. 
6. Calibration took a long time. Max value is: 21
  Before start next section, give extra K dose. It is a tiny dose... 1 hr 23 minutes. 
7. ae neural recording. started 1 hr and 27 minutes in. Gain = 500, no filters on preamp.
   q1: Am I railing if I use no filters? Not railing. Signal looks food. Stick with no filters. 
   It is unclear that having a 1MHz low pass reall improves the SNR.. maybe it does? I could also do this in software. The front up filters is good as it is at the beginning before digitization. 

8. 10.8, -4.3, 7.4
   10.98, 5.77, 7.47 The original signal itself is tiny. Maybe if I had a way to analyse it  10.86 4.0 -0.3

9. two tone test. 1000 microvolts 500kHz signal. 30 microvolt. 
   mouse is starting to wake. I think.. this was a better two tone test than the one I did before... Check it. 

Mouse to warming chamber at 12:33, wet mash in prep. 
Total time:  2 hrs 28mins. 
12:35pm

There is a bubble in my ultrasound.
