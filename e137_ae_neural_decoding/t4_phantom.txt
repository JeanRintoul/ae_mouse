t4 - small amplitudes. 
=================================================================

- I don't need that many recordings to see something. 
- maybe the current density is higher? 

1. measurements of the acoustoelectric effect, and the center frequency without F21. 4 recordings. 
- pressure = 1MPa. gain = 500. vout = 0.1V. duration = 8s. 
- preamp 0.3V -> 1MPa bandpass. 

- - set up with dual stim electrode, and m in the middle. 
2. Folder name: 8Hz_25microv
applied signal size = 45 microvolts. 
df size             = 0.1 microvolts. 
signal snr/kaiser snr/individual_signal snr:  11.06 37.76 28.47
Clearly visible after 3 recordings.

3. Folder name: 8Hz_3microv
applied signal size = 4 microvolts. 
df size             = 0.01 microvolts. 
signal snr/kaiser snr/individual_signal snr:  
Nothing. Maybe the matching filter would help? 

4. Folder name: 8Hz_15microv. Works. Can see it at 5 files. 
signal snr/kaiser snr/individual_signal snr: 10.93 29.49 18.68   5 files
signal snr/kaiser snr/individual_signal snr: 10.94 31.43 18.88   10 files. 

5. vout = 0.02 at 8hz. 8 microvolts. 
signal snr/kaiser snr/individual_signal snr: 10.85 8.75 8.28  5 files. 
signal snr/kaiser snr/individual_signal snr: 10.86 7.19 4.32  10 files. 
It's sort of at the noise floor here. 

6. vout = 0.02 at 26hz. 20 microvolts. (v out = 0.02). I guess this higher f travels further than the low f signal. 
signal snr/kaiser snr/individual_signal snr:  -4.89 7.42 -2.33   5 files.
signal snr/kaiser snr/individual_signal snr:  -4.82 23.03 14.91  10 files.
This doesnt seem much better than 8 microvolts, but then the regular thermal noise floor is flat at 8Hz in phantom.

TODO: Plot of SNR improvement with iterative averaging. 
 At some level, I cannot overcome the noise floor however... Does match filtering work here? 
TODO: try applying matching filter to these to see if my algorithm works. 
TODO: try doing ketamine demodulation. I do not need that many files as the signal is big. I can do it on the files I already have. File averaging and time syncing isn't useful here. However, the signal is SO large. 
TODO: Noise floor comparison between the mouse, and the phantom. 
Is it the noise floor I am looking at due to electrical reflections in the US, or is this noise floor generated by the neural signals?
