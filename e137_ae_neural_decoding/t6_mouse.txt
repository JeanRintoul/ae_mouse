iso = 1.0 
1. 4Hz VEP in total darkness. 16 microvolt pp vep at 8hz. 
   The whole signal goes 200 microvolt +-... i.e. 400 pp which is smaller than ketamine. 

3. Calibration. Isnt really working? Maybe I have the stim electrodes plugged in wrong... or gnding to the headplate? 

For some reason, unknown to me, ae amplitude is up at 55-60? 
Im not convinced I am calibrating well. However, the values are high. 

4. Preamp gain 500, 0.3Hz-1MHz. Pressure 1MPa. 12s duration. Neural recording. Total darkness. The signal has a really high electrical content? 
If anything the noise level looks high. 

20 files. Something seems to be not quite right about my position calibration. TO fix. 
vp = 0.12

5. move transducer forward a bit, so there is no metal in the way... and try again. 
   vp = 0.1 5hz vep. 

6. Go for size with a 2hz vep? 0.1v out for pressure. The amplitude is pretty small right now. VEP is still there though.

TODO: 
Do plot of averaging n with respect to noise level. This will tell me how many repeats I need to see the signal, assuming I have the position correct.

Things to work on:
1. accurate position calibration. 
2. what snr and how many repeats do i actually need to get a result? Can I calculate it? 
   What is the size of the signal that I expect. 
3. How to get a bigger VEP.
