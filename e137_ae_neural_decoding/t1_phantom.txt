t1 - do a with and without F21 test. 
=================================================================

- 1MPa. I want to be able to see the electrical attenuation clearly. 
- Consider trying with applying a voltage, so that I can do SNR measurements with and without F21? 
- Ideally also test that my transducer works, because last test I was getting very small amplitudes in the mouse. 

Phantom Test Day: 
1. Does my ultrasound still work? I was getting super low amplitude e signals... why? Yes it does work! phew! 
2. F21: FFT plot of with and without the 1.3mm thick F21 showing how the 500kHz amplitude changes. Distance view and zoom view to see apodization change.  
Do an SNR calculation with an acoustoelectric field with and without the F21.
3. Phantom test with vertically aligned stim electrodes and measurement electrode between. Can I enhance the PRF electrical amplitude, by applying a time synced electric field either in phase, or 180 degree out of phase(i.e. wires turned the other way)? 

Prepare for mouse tests on Tuesday, if all goes ok. 

= = = =
1. Yes, the ultrasound now emits about 1000 microvolts at 1MPa, with no F21. I can confirm that it appears water leaked out of transducer in previous exps. This means that I may still have the result. 

2. Calibration and test if ultrasound is working. It's at 2000. 
    Wait... I need a high pass filter to remove the 9kHz signal. 

3. measurements of the acoustoelectric effect, and the center frequency without F21. 4 recordings. 
- pressure = 1MPa. gain = 500. vout = 0.1V. duration = 8s. 
- preamp 0.3V -> 1MPa bandpass. 

applied signal size = 122 microvolts. 
df size             = 0.1 microvolts. 
kaiser SNR = 28.95. raw signal SNR = 11.09

Clearly visible after 4 recordings. 

4. With F21. Exactly the same everything else. 
applied signal size = 122 microvolts. 
df size             = 0.06 microvolts. 
kaiser SNR = 24. raw signal SNR = 11.1

Here the raw signal SNR is slightly higher. This is actually what we want to change to obtain a better demodulation, the kaiser window is just for looking at the FFT. Is it meaningfully higher? Unclear, each recording is a little different. Also, the F21 decreases the pressure that reaches the focal point. 

5. With F21, increase the pressure to v out = 0.14. 

applied signal size = 122 microvolts. 
df size             = 0.16 microvolts. 
kaiser SNR = 14 raw signal SNR = 11.27
With higher pressure, I don't necessarily get a better result, as the high amplitude pressure signal creates noise around the frequency of interest. So my noise floor is larger. The acoustoelectric amplitude is also larger. 

6. pressure vout = 0.08

It does seem like 
- I did some analysis, and it seems to work much better without F21 in place... 
Lets get a bigger N. 

7. Trying again without F21 in place. My conclusion - is that it is better not to use F21. Also - simpler. 

8. PRF study with and without e field. Yes it gets bigger when I add en electric field that is vertically aligned. But I am getting all this other weird non-linear stuff too.

I adjusted the preamp to gain = 100, and removed band-pass filter in case that is causing the non-linear responses. It is not the gain that is generating the non-linear response. 
Maybe it is a phase shift between the pressure and the current? The pressure changes phase... 

The response amplitude is directional. This could also just indicate that the measurement electrode is closer to one side or the other. 

What happens if I apply just an e field? Yep - it is all coming from the efield. 
- I moved the return(GND) electrode for the e stim to be more distant. 
Amplitude got Bigger... oh crap, i had 8hz as the current frequency - this was my problem. Dumb! 

Lets add a low pass filter to the preamp, to remove the e field at 500khz. 
51 microvolts at 1Hz, when I apply both pressure and voltage. 

Re-set up for saline, including a repeated calibration step. 

RF amplifier is having a DC fault. It isn't working. 

What to do here? 
Try using D Bono's voltage adapter? 

I can generate a signal. but I am not sure it is large enough. 

- How big was the old signal? it was plus 20-minus 20. 
40v pp
I can get to 20vpp. 
- Lets open up and take a look at the RF amplifier. 

My ultrasound is not outputting. There is a single small bubble there.. 
Wait - i had a 30k low pass filter... blah. 

Everything is fine, everything is dandy. 
Today, I got small DC offsets, even with a continuous wave. 
Other times I have got a bigger DC offset. I am not sure why. 
I am however, ready to do a mouse test, this time for ae neural recording with no F21.
