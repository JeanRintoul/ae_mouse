t7 - ultrasound motor threshold test with and without F21, and attempt to get EMG without heart beat. 
======================================================================================

- I have new F21
- I will have two electrodes in the tail or tail and leg to measure EMG without heart rate. 
- Plan is to cycle the F21, each time using a new piece. 
- preamp filter try 1k low pass only
- lp hardware filter is in place. 
Use mouse with vertical implant, as I do not need to plug it in as I am measuring from elsewhere.

- The US low signal is far smaller when i have both electrodes in the leg. 
- It may be worth having both a brain measurement, and an EMG measurement? 
- I am not seeing any EMG like I was yesterday? Could it be my electrode placement? 

Note: this is a small female mouse.

- The fact I could measure EMG yesterday at all, suggests I was inducing a high amplitude low frequency signal... However, when the mouse was coming out of anesthesia, I saw onset and wiggle activity, not a clear sine wave of motion or EMG. 

1hr 18 minutes, I start getting motion. 
finished 1 hr 37 minutes in. 

Threshold is: 0.35 for a clear signal. 

- Result, bypassing the heart DOES lead to less artifact in the EMG. 

My F21 is only 1mm thickm which is too thin to attenuate the electrical signal enough. 

TODO: make slightly thicker F21. 2mm thick. #

- I sort of need to amplifier channels at the same time. One for EMG and one for brain? 
- There is a second SR560.
