t5 - ae mouse test, with two daisy chained bono tx to get to higher voltages. 
==========================================================================

Mouse 7 

Goal: What is the largest AE field I can generate? 

Mouse, F21, 1k low pass only. FG Fs 5MHz. 2 daisy chained txs. 

Measurement electrode in tail and head. 

New: Use PtIr stimulation electrodes. One in mouth, one on head. 

Intermittently do US pulse stimulation, to see if I can get a response at all. 

- preamp filter try 1k low pass only
- lp hardware filter is in place.

- mouse took a while to stop moving. I may have slightly underdosed it. 
- I gave it k2 at 15 minutes in.
- mouse is still not down at 20 minutes in. 
- 25 minutes in, it is not down, despite having x and 2x kets
Should I stop, and get another mouse to start fresh? 

TODO: 
Try ae mep, switch and pulse mep at the largest amplitudes I have. 
Which is biggest? 

I have PtIr ring electrode on head, and loop electrode in mouth. 

- at v=12, it maxes at 54Vpp in the mouse. This is half the amplitude I need. 
  awaiting Robin Cleveland's response. 

I just saw EMG when applying 8hz. 

Go to DF = 1Hz, gain = 100

- ae loo test: I seem to be getting something, EMG shows it, despite mouse being under anesthesia. 

loo test 1Hz worked. 

loo test 0.5Hz I couldnt see it super clear... 

1hr 14 minutes, it is responding when I do US mep. 

It is responding mostly to the US onset... 

i messed up the recording of the last set by touching stuff. 

So when the pressure is too high, the DC offset of the continuous wave dominates. What I'd like is the voltage to be higher, so that I can apply lower pressures(less DC offset). 

Also, better F21 mastery may help here to reduce this issue. 
After a while, the F21 saturates. It is possible what I need to do is change it over sometimes so a new dry one is there. 

- This file shows the issue of the DC offset from the ultrasound. 
This issue should be shown in the supplement on the ae neuromodulation figure.
