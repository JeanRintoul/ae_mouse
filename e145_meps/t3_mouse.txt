t2 - motor threshold test, using a pulse with and without F21. 
========================================================

Mouse M3
- At what threshold do I get a pulse motor response in the mouse? 
- add 20% and the F21, do I see a motor response? What is the motor response threshold? 
- repeat 3 times? 

No mouth or stim electrode required. Just measurement electrodes? One in tail, one in brain. 

Measurement electrode in tail, same as other measurements.

Start without F21. 

gain = 500. low pass filter 

- While mouse is in deep anesthesia, I try to refine difference delta code. 
difference delta seems more effective at df = 1

With just an ultrasound pulse, the e field amplitude is HUGE. 

- us pulse mep, 6 second duration. 3 pulses. over 1000 microvolts in amplitude. This seems sure to induce a mep... p out = 0.2 

With just an ultrasound pulse, the e field amplitude at low frequencies is HUGE when I don't use F21.

I am guessing that this e field amplitude, is going to do something when the anesthesia is lower. 
It is very simple and clear. 

- p out = 0.1 df = 625 microvolts. 


- I can ideally show that the size of the MEP is proportional to the evoked electric field. 


- In this motor threshold experiment, do everything at the motor threshold of no F21. Then swap enough times to show the effect is not due to the anesthesia level. 

I have movement at 0.2

End:11am. 

Result:
Positive: I got movements when I had very high electrical amplitudes. 
Negative: The F21 didnt provide electrical isolation past the first time. Perhaps because the whole thing was slightly damp? This echoes what I see in the ae neural recording as well. 
That means the first use of F21 recordings are good... 

It DOES look like I successfully got EMG this time. ANALYSE it. This is because I actually induced a movement. 

-- - 

Thoughts: The amplitude is really high compared to what I get normally with the ae effect. This is because the voltage from the transducer is ALSO really high. 

Is there a way I can feasibly apply such a high voltage to the mouse? For instance, can I daisy chain two of BONOs TX together? Can I use that mesh thing to apply the v signal on the head, or another cup electrode? 

--- - - 

It would be good if I had more F21... so I could place it again and again and itd be fresh...
