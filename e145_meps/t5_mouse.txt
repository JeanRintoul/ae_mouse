t5 - ae mouse test, with a daisy chained bono tx to get to higher voltages. 
==========================================================================

Mouse M6. This time do ae field with two daisy chained bono tx's. 
Either apply this through a cup electrode in the gel, or the mesh. 
Use F21. 
Measurement electrode in tail, same as other measurements. 

If it doesn't work, daisy chain 3 tx's.

Ketamine. 
Ket/Xyl
drugs:
antidote: 4.4
X: 1.1
k1: 1.1
k2: 1.0
saline: 50

Date of experiment: 27/05/2024  
Mouse Cage: 131589
Number of uses before: 2
Gender: male
Weight: 24g including headbar. 
DOB: 24.12.2023

- this one is going down slowly. It may need more ketamine. 

- all set up, with gold cup electrode in mouth, and in US gel for stim electrodes. 

- i am getting only 54v pp - i dont think this is enough, need the third tx. 

- i am seeing mostly dc offset, and minimal df. maybe 800uv... 
putting the df at 0.25 yields a signal with df at 1hz?

This may have something to do with how I am applying the voltage? 
The beat frequency is coming from the tx. 

- I do still get a df between the US and the tx though... so there is hope. 

1hr 13m mouse is on: 

MOvements even for pulse mep were not that clear this time.
